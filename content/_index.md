* Run containerized stateful applications that are highly-available (HA) across multiple nodes, cloud instances, regions, data centers or even clouds
* Migrate workflows between multiple clusters running across same or hybrid clouds
* Run hyperconverged workloads where the data resides on the same host as the applications
* Have programmatic control on your storage resources
