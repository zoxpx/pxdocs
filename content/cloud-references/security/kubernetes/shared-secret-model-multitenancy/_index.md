# Overview

Kubernetes provides a great way to isolate account resources using
namespaces, but you may want a more secure multitenant solution. Portworx
can greatly enhance the multitenant model by providing resource access
control for application volumes.

The following reference architecture provides a model where volume access
is authenticated using tokens stored in the secret of the namespace of the
tenant.
