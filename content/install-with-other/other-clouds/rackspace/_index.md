{{<info>}}
This document presents a **non-Kubernetes** method of installing a Portworx cluster. Please refer to the [Portworx on Kubernetes](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/) page if you want to install Portworx on Kubernetes.
{{</info>}}

This guide show you how you can easily deploy Portworx on [**Rackspace**](https://www.rackspace.com/login)


### Step 1: Provision Cloud Server
When chosing an instance, verify that you meet the [minimum requirements](/start-here-installation/#installation-prerequisites)

<!--Detailed Rackspace steps to build a [cloud server](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/create-a-cloud-server/)-->
{{<companyName>}} recommends a minimum cluster of 3 nodes



### Step 2. Create a volume and attach it to a Rackspace VM
Follow the instuctions from Rackspace documentation [Create and attach a Cloud Block Storage volume](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/create-and-attach-a-cloud-block-storage-volume/)

Your deployment will look something like the following:

Note: Volume cannot not be attached until the server is available


### Step 3: Install Docker for the appropriate OS Version
{{<companyName>}} recommends Docker 1.12 with [Device Mapper](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/#/configure-docker-with-devicemapper).

### Step 4: Launch {{< pxEnterprise >}}
Note: Before installing Portworx you will need to open ports as per [minimum requirements](/start-here-installation/#installation-prerequisites) on the local firewall.  You can view Rackspaces [firewall documentation](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/open-ports-in-the-linux-firewall-to-access-pop-and-imap-mail-servers/)

<!--
I can't figure out the target for this link... Also, launching {{< pxEnterprise >}} seem to be documented in the next paragraph

[Follow the instructions to launch {{< pxEnterprise >}}](/#install-with-a-container-orchestrator)
-->

Use the docker run command to launch {{< pxEnterprise >}}, substituting the appropriate multipath devices and network interfaces, as identified from the previous steps.

Alternatively, you can either run the 'px_bootstrap' script from curl, or construct your own [config.json](/shared/install-with-other-docker-config-json) file.

From the server node running px-enterprise container, you should see the following status:

![PX-Cluster on Rackspace](/img/rackspace-pxctl-status.png "PX-Cluster on Azure")


You should also be able to monitor cluster from {{< pxEnterprise >}} console:
