## Prerequisites

* You must have a Kubernetes cluster imported into Rancher
* Your cluster must meet the [requirements](/start-here-installation/) for installing a Portworx cluster

## Install Portworx on Kubernetes using Rancher 2.x

Perform the following steps to install Portworx:

1. Go to your cluster, and then select the **System** namespace. The following screenshot uses a cluster named `dev` as an example:

5. Populate the various required sections of the **Configuration Options** of the Helm chart form:

     * (Skip this section if you're installing Portworx Essentials ) In the **Key Value Store Paramters** section, specify an internal or external ETCD.

    Depending on your network and cluster performance, it may take between 5 and 20 minutes to install Portworx. Once the installation is completed, the Portworx processes will be shown as green.
    
## Troubleshooting

If pods remain in **Unavailable** state, check the pod events to see all Kubernetes events related to the selected pod:
    
1. Navigate to **Portworx** in **Workloads** section.
