{{<info>}}
This document presents the **non-Kubernetes** method of migrating volumes between two Portworx clusters. Please refer to the [Migration with Stork on Kubernetes](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/migration) page if you are running Portworx on Kubernetes.
{{</info>}}

## Overview

This method can be used to migrate volumes between two Portworx clusters. It will not migrate any scheduler specific resources.

## Pre-requisites

* **Version**: The source AND destination clusters need the v2.0 or later
release of {{< pxEnterprise >}} on both clusters. As future releases are made, the two clusters can have different {{< pxEnterprise >}} versions (e.g. v2.1 and v2.3).
* **Secret Store** : Make sure you have configured a [secret store](/key-management) on both your clusters.
This will be used to store the credentials for the objectstore.
* **Network Connectivity**: Ports 9001 and 9010 on the destination cluster should be
reachable by the source cluster.

## Pairing clusters

### Get cluster token from destination cluster

On the destination cluster, run the following command from one of the Portworx nodes to get the cluster token:

```text
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cluster token show
```

### Create the cluster pair

On the source cluster create the clusterpair by running the following command:

```text
pxctl cluster pair create --ip <ip_of_destination_cluster_node> --token <token_from_destination_cluster>
```

### Verify creation of cluster pair

If the above step is successful you should see the destination cluster in the list of pairs:

```text
pxctl cluster pair list
```

```output
CLUSTER-ID                                       NAME            ENDPOINT                     CREDENTIAL-ID
2937523c-a8f6-4564-a683-e3b53b92a3b7 (default)   disrani-px2     http://192.168.56.106:9001   952e15df-ca3e-49df-8c20-92f862a44a78
```

## Migrating Volumes

Once you have created cluster pairs you can migrate volumes to it.

{{<info>}}
**NOTE:** If your cluster has a DR license applied to it, you can only perform migrations in DR mode; this includes operations involving the `pxctl cluster migrate` command.
{{</info>}}

### Start migration

Migration can be done at two granularities. If no ClusterID is specified during migration it'll pick up the default cluster pair.

* Migrate all volumes from the cluster:

```text
pxctl cloudmigrate start --all [ --cluster_id <cluster_id> ]
```

* Migrate a particular volume from the cluster:

```text
pxctl cloudmigrate start --volume_id <volumeId> [ --cluster_id <cluster_id> ]
```

### Monitor migrations

You can check the migration status by running the following command:

```text
pxctl cloudmigrate status
```

```output
CLUSTER UUID: 2937523c-a8f6-4564-a683-e3b53b92a3b7
TASK-ID                                  VOLUME-ID           VOLUME-NAME  STAGE  STATUS      LAST-UPDATE
107655ea-0f66-4ffe-99e2-1ef06434aa40     589129994411792979  testVolume   Done   Complete    Sat, 27 Oct 2018 01:12:40 UTC
```

The stages of migration will progress from Backup→ Restore→Done. If any stage fails the status will be marked as Failed.

If the migration is successful you should be able to see the volume(s) with the same name created on the destination cluster.
