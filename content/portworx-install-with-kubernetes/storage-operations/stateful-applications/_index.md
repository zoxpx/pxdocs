With Portworx, you can backup and restore stateful applications and their volumes to an external object store. Specifically, you can perform the following operations:

* Backup an application
* Restore an application
* Clone an application between namespaces
* Schedule application backup operations

## Prerequisites

All application storage operations require the following prerequisites:

* Stork 2.3
* Administrator-level cluster privileges if you operate between namespaces
* Portworx 2.2

## Configure Application Backups

Configure application backups by creating and applying the following CRDs:

* backupLocation
* applicationBackup

### Create a backupLocation CRD

Use the backupLocation CRD to specify the configuration information for your object store. Portworx supports the following object stores:

* Any S3-compliant object store
* Azure Blob Storage
* Google Cloud Storage

The example in this document uses an S3 bucket to store application backup data.

```
"endpoint" : "bucketEndpoint.com"
"key": "ABCDEF1234567890"
"secret": "ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890"
```

You can specify your object store credentials directly in the BackupLocation configuration as plaintext or use a Kubernetes secret:

#### Plaintext credentials

1. Create a backupLocation YAML file, specifying the following:

  * **name:** the backupLocation object's name
  * **namespace:** the namespace the backupLocation exists in
  * **location:**
      * **type:** the object store type
      * **path:** the bucket Portworx will use for the backup
      * **s3Config:**
          * **region:** which region your s3 bucket is located in
          * **accessKeyID:** your bucket's accessKeyID
          * **secretAccessKey:** your bucket's secretAccessKey
          * **endpoint:** the URL or IP address of your bucket
          * **disableSSL:** whether or not to disable SSL

    ```text
    apiVersion: stork.libopenstorage.org/v1alpha1
    kind: BackupLocation
    metadata:
      name: mysql
      namespace: mysql-app
      annotations:
        stork.libopenstorage.org/skipresource: "true"
    location:
      type: s3
      path: "bucket-name"
      s3Config:
        region: us-east-1
        accessKeyID: ABCDEF1234567890
        secretAccessKey: ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890
        endpoint: "https://bucketEndpoint.com"
        disableSSL: false
    ```

    {{<info>}}
**Note:** If you use URL as your bucket endpoint, you must include the http prefix: either `https://` or `http://`, depending on whether or not you're using SSL.
    {{</info>}}


2. Apply the YAML:

    ```text
    kubectl apply -f backLo.yaml
    ```

#### Kubernetes secret containing your credentials

1. Create a Kubernetes Secret YAML file, specifying the following:

  * **name:** the Secret object's name
  * **namespace:** the namespace the Secret exists in
  <!-- *  annotations?? -->
  * **stringData:**
      * **region:** which region your s3 bucket is located in
      * **accessKeyID:** your bucket's accessKeyID
      * **secretAccessKey:** your bucket's secretAccessKey
      * **endpoint:** the URL or IP address of your bucket
      * **disableSSL:** whether or not to disable SSL
      * **encryptionKey:** your secret's encryption key

    ```text
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      metadata:
        name: s3secret
        namespace: mysql
        annotations:
          stork.libopenstorage.org/skipresource: "true"
      stringData:
        region: us-east-1
        accessKeyID: AB123AB43678AABCD12P
        secretAccessKey: b7D9pA3214Vafo8432023ajksndas43242kjsnfdk
        endpoint: "70.0.0.141:9010"
        disableSSL: "false"
        encryptionKey: "testKey"
      ```

2. Apply the Secret's YAML file:

    ```text
    kubectl apply -f s3secret.yaml
    ```

3. Create a backupLocation YAML file, specifying the following:

  * **name:** the backupLocation object's name
  * **namespace:** the namespace the backupLocation exists in
  * **location:**
      * **type:** the object store type
      * **path:** the bucket Portworx will use for the backup
      * **secretConfig:** the Secret object containing your bucket's credentials

    ```text
    apiVersion: stork.libopenstorage.org/v1alpha1
    kind: BackupLocation
    metadata:
      name: mysql-backup
      namespace: mysql
      annotations:
        stork.libopenstorage.org/skipresource: "true"
    location:
      type: s3
      path: "bucket-name"
      secretConfig: s3secret
    ```

    {{<info>}}
**Note:** If you use URL as your bucket endpoint, you must include the http prefix: either `https://` or `http://`, depending on whether or not you're using SSL.
    {{</info>}}


4. Apply the YAML:

    ```text
    kubectl apply -f backLo.yaml
    ```


### Create an applicationBackup CRD

Use the applicationBackup CRD to specify what namespaces have their applications backed-up.

1. Create an applicationbackup YAML file, specifying the following:

  * **name:** the applicationBackup object's name
  * **namespace:** the namespace the applicationBackup exists in
  * **spec:**
      * **backupLocation:** what backupLocation object to use to determine where to send the backup
      * **namespaces:** the namespaces to backup
      * **reclaimPolicy:** what happens to objects in the object store when the `ApplicationBackup` object is deleted, either `Delete` or `Retain`
      * **selectors:** define specific labels to determine which objects and volumes are backed-up
      * **preExecRule:** what rule to run before performing backup
      * **postExecRule:** what rule to run after performing backup

    ```text
    apiVersion: stork.libopenstorage.org/v1alpha1
    kind: ApplicationBackup
    metadata:
      name: backup
      namespace: mysql-app
    spec:
      backupLocation: mysql
      namespaces:
      - mysql-app
      reclaimPolicy: Delete
      selectors:
      preExecRule:
      postExecRule:
    ```

2. Apply the YAML:

    ```text
    kubectl apply -f appBack.yaml
    ```

3. Verify the applicationBackup object's status with the `storkctl get` command. You can see what stage the backup is in, as well as its status:

    ```text
    storkctl get applicationbackup -n mysql-app
    ```
    ```output
    NAME      STAGE     STATUS    VOLUMES   RESOURCES   CREATED               ELAPSED
    backup    Volumes   Pending   0/0       0           11 Sep 19 22:10 UTC   19.023065649s
    ```

    You can also describe the object to get more information about the backup. This is useful for troubleshooting:
    ```text
    kubectl describe applicationbackup.stork.libopenstorage.org -n mysql-app
    ```

    The following error message displays when your credentials are invalid.

    ```output
    Warning  Failed  7s  stork  Error starting ApplicationBackup for volumes: rpc error: code = Internal desc = Failed to create backup: Failed to validate credentials: error validating credential: AccessDenied: Access Denied.
             status code: 403, request id: 15C38376E0A0EA7F, host id:
    ```

### Create an ApplicationBackupSchedule CRD

The ApplicationBackupSchedule CRD associates a SchedulePolicy with an application backup operation, allowing you to schedule when and how application backups are performed.

1. Create a SchedulePolicy YAML file, specifying the following:

  * **name:** the SchedulePolicy object's name
  * **policy:**
      * **interval:** For interval backups, how frequently Portworx will back the application up
          * **intervalMinutes:** The interval, in minutes, after which Portworx starts the application backup
          * **retain:** How many backups Portworx will retain.
      * **daily:** For daily backups, Portworx will start the backup at the specified time every day
          * **time:**
          * **retain:** How many backups Portworx will retain.
      * **weekly:** For weekly backups, Portworx will start the backup at the specified day and time every week
          * **day:** The backup day, specified by string
          * **time:** The backup time, specified in 12 hour AM/PM format
          * **retain:** How many backups Portworx will retain.
      * **monthly:** for monthly backups, Portworx will start the backup at the specified day and time every month
          * **date:** The backup day, specified as an integer
          * **time:** the backup time, specified in 12 hour AM/PM format
          * **retain:** How many backups Portworx will retain.

    ```text
    apiVersion: stork.libopenstorage.org/v1alpha1
    kind: SchedulePolicy
    metadata:
      name: backupSchedule
    policy:
      interval:
        intervalMinutes: 60
        retain: 5
      daily:
        time: "10:14PM"
        retain: 5
      weekly:
        day: "Thursday"
        time: "10:13PM"
        retain: 5
      monthly:
        date: 14
        time: "8:05PM"
        retain: 5
    ```

    {{<info>}}
**NOTE:** If you do not specify the value of the `retain` field, Portworx will use the following default values:

| Policy | Default value |
|:---:|:---:|
| Interval | 10 |
| Daily | 30 |
| Weekly | 7 |
| Monthly | 12 |
    {{</info>}}


2. Create an ApplicationBackupSchedule YAML file, specifying the following:

  * **name:** the applicationBackupSchedule object's name
  * **namespace:** the namespace the applicationBackupSchedule exists in
  * **spec:**
      * **schedulePolicyName:** the name of the schedule policy that defines when backup actions happen
      * **template:**
          * **spec:**
              * **backupLocation:** the name of the backup location spec
              * **namespaces:** namespaces which will be backed up
              * **reclaimPolicy:** what happens to objects in the object store when the `ApplicationBackup` object is deleted

    ```text
    apiVersion: stork.libopenstorage.org/v1alpha1
    kind: ApplicationBackupSchedule
    metadata:
      name: backup
      namespace: mysql
    spec:
      schedulePolicyName: testpolicy
      template:
        spec:
          backupLocation: mysql
          namespaces:
          - mysql
          reclaimPolicy: Delete
    ```

## Restore an application

You can restore an application by applying an ApplicationRestore object.

{{<info>}}
**NOTE:** If you're restoring an application across namespaces on OpenShift, you must modify your destination namespace to include the same supplemental group annotation values as your source namespace:

```text
annotations:
  openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs: s0:c26,c25
  openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups: 1001990000/10000
  openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range: 1001990000/10000
```

{{</info>}}

1. Create an ApplicationRestore YAML file, specifying the following:

  * **name:** the ApplicationRestore object's name
  * **namespace:** the ApplicationRestore object's namespace
  * **spec:**
      * **backupName:** the name of the `applicationBackup` object to restore from
      * **backupLocation:** which backup location object to get application backups from
      * **namespaceMapping:** a map of source and destination namespaces, allowing you to restore a backup to a different namespace
      * **replacePolicy:** specifies whether you want to delete or retain any matching existing resource in the target namespace

    ```text
    apiVersion: stork.libopenstorage.org/v1alpha1
    kind: ApplicationRestore
    metadata:
      name: restore
      namespace: mysql-app
    spec:
      backupName: backup
      backupLocation: mysql
      namespaceMapping:
        mysql: mysql
      replacePolicy: Delete
    ```

    {{<info>}}
**Note:** You can run the `storkctl get applicationbackup -n namespace` command to help you see which backup to restore from.
    {{</info>}}

2. Apply the YAML:

    ```text
    kubectl apply -f appRestore.yaml
    ```

The moment you apply the YAML, the application begins to restore. Monitor the status with the `storkctl get` command:

```text
storkctl get applicationrestore -n mysql-app
```
```output
NAME      STAGE     STATUS       VOLUMES   RESOURCES   CREATED               ELAPSED
restore   Final     Successful   1/1       3           11 Sep 19 23:32 UTC   35s
```

Verify its status with the `kubectl get pods` command:

```text
kubectl get pods -n mysql-app
```
```output
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-6d69b99774-2bv4m   0/1     Pending   0          3s
```

## Clone an Application

You can clone an application to a different namespace or within the same namespace. You must create the `ApplicationClone` object in the **admin** namespace, which is `kube-system` by default.

{{<info>}}
**NOTE:**

* If you're cloning an application across namespaces on OpenShift, you must modify your destination namespace to include the same supplemental group annotation values as your source namespace:

    ```text
    annotations:
      openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs: s0:c26,c25
      openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups: 1001990000/10000
      openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range: 1001990000/10000
    ```

* Distributed apps, such as Cassandra, may use the same node IDs on the destination namespace as their source, causing disruption when the new nodes join the source cluster.
{{</info>}}

1. Create a an ApplicationClone YAML file, specifying the following:

    * **name:** the ApplicationClone object's name
    * **namespace:** the ApplicationClone object's namespace
    * **spec:**
        * **sourceNamespace:** the namespace you want to clone applications _from_
        * **destinationNamespace:** the namespace you want to clone applications _to_

    ```text
    apiVersion: stork.libopenstorage.org/v1alpha1
    kind: ApplicationClone
    metadata:
      name: clone-mysql
      namespace: kube-system
    spec:
      sourceNamespace: mysql-app
      destinationNamespace: clone-mysql
    ```

2. Apply the YAML file:

    ```text
    kubectl apply -f appClone.yaml
    ```
