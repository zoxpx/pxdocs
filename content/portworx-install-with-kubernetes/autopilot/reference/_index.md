### selector

Selects the objects affected by this rule using a matchLabels label selector.

```text
selector:
  matchLabels:
    <selector-key>: <selector-value>
```

### namespaceSelector

Selects the namespaces affected by this rule using a matchLabels label selector.

```text
namespaceSelector:
  matchLabels:
    <selector-key>:<selector-value>
```

### conditions

Defines the metrics that need to be for the rule's actions to trigger.

Conditions compare the `key` field with the `values` field using the `operator` field. Condition keys can contain logic and use monitoring values.

```text
conditions:
  - key: "<condition-formula>"
    operator: <logical-operator>
    values:
    - "<comparator>"
``` 

It follows the below schema.

| Field                     	| Description                                                                                                                                                                                           	| Optional? 	| Default    	|
|---------------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------	|------------	|
| **key**                    	| This is the metrics query that would be sent to the monitoring provider (e.g prometheus).                                                                                                             	| no        	| empty      	|
| **operator**                 	| This is the logical operator to use to compare the results of the query in key above to the values. Supported operators are: <ul><li>`In`<li>`NotIn`<li>`Lt`<li>`Gt`<li>`LtEq`<li>`GtEq`<li>`InRange`<li>`NotInRange`</ul>  | no        	| empty      	|
| **values**                  	| This is the value or list of values against which the key and operator are compared. <ul><li>`In`, `NotIn` need a list of values<li> `Gt`, `Lt`, `GtEq`, `LtEq` need a single numerical value.<li>`InRange`, `NotInRange` need exactly 2 numerical values</ul>                                                                                                           	|     no    	| empty      	|


{{<info>}}Multiple conditions are combined using a logical AND.{{</info>}}

### actions

Defines what action to take when the conditions are met. See the [Supported Actions](#supported-autopilot-actions) section for the list of actions that you can specify.

```text
action:
  name: <operation>
  params:
    <operation-specific-paramater>: <value>
    maxsize: "<value>Gi"
```

## Supported Autopilot actions

### openstorage.io.action.volume/resize

This action is to perform resize on Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).

##### Parameters

* **scalepercentage**: Specifies the percentage of current PVC size by which Autopilot should resize the PVC. If not specified, the default is *50%*.
* **maxsize**: Specifies the maximum PVC size in bytes after which Autopilot should stop resizing the PVCs. Note that you can specify the unit of measurement as part of the value. For example, if you want to use GiB, you can specify the unit of measurement like this: `maxsize: "400Gi"`. If not specified, the default value is unlimited.


##### Examples

Resize the PVC by 100% of current size

```text
  actions:
  - name: openstorage.io.action.volume/resize
    params:
      scalepercentage: "100"
      maxsize: "12Gi"
```


### openstorage.io.action.storagepool/expand

This action is to perform expansion on Portworx Storage Pools.

##### Parameters

* **scalepercentage**: Specifies the percentage of current Pool size by which Autopilot should resize it. If not specified, the default is *50%*.
* **scaletype**: Specifies the type of operation to be performed to expand the pool. Supported values are:
    * *add-disk*: Portworx will add new disk(s) to the existing storage pool
    * *resize-disk*: Portworx will resize existing disks in the storage pool
* **scalesize**: Specifies the amount, in Gi or Ti, by which Autopilot should expand a storage pool.

{{<info>}}
**NOTE:** You cannot combine the **scalepercentage** and **scalesize** parameters; use only one of them in an Autopilot rule.
{{</info>}}

##### Examples

Expand the pool by 50% of current size by adding disks

```text
  actions:
  - name: openstorage.io.action.storagepool/expand
    params:
      scalepercentage: "50"
      scaletype: "add-disk"
```

Expand the pool by 100Gi by resizing disks

```text
  actions:
  - name: openstorage.io.action.storagepool/expand
    params:
      scalesize: "100Gi"
      scaletype: "resize-disk"
```

#### Use cases

* [Automatically expand storage pools by usage](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/autopilot/use-cases/autogrow-pool/)
* [Expand all storage pools](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/autopilot/use-cases/autogrow-all-pools/)

### openstorage.io.action.storagepool/rebalance

This action performs a rebalance operation on Portworx Storage Pools.

#### Use cases

 * [Automatically rebalance storage pools based on provisioned and used space](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/autopilot/use-cases/rebalance-pool/)

## Autopilot Events

You can view the actions Autopilot takes by querying Autopilot events. These events provide insight into how your Autopilot rules are functioning, what actions they may be taking, and what actions they have taken in the past.

| **Autopilot rule event** | **Description** |
| ---- | ---- |
| Initializing | The rule's initial startup state where monitoring has not yet begun. |
| Normal | Autopilot is monitoring the rule as expected. |
| Triggered | The rule has its activation conditions met. |
| ActiveActionsPending | The rule's activation conditions have been met, but the actions are not yet being performed. |
| ActiveActionsTaken | Autopilot has performed the rule's actions, but still hasn't moved out of the active status. |
| ActionsDeclined | Autopilot has intentionally declined to perform a rule's action, for example when a PVC reaches a maximum user-defined size. |
| ActiveActionsInProgress | The rule is active and had its conditions met and there is an ongoing action on the object. |
| ActionNotLicensed | The action Autopilot is trying to perform is not permitted due to license restrictions |

You can query events from Kubernetes by entering the following `kubectl get events` command:

```text
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=AutopilotRule
```
