Autopilot is a rule-based engine that responds to changes from a monitoring source. Autopilot allows you to specify monitoring conditions along with actions it should take when those conditions occur.

![Autopilot Overview](/img/autopilot-overview.gif)

With Autopilot, your cluster can react dynamically without your intervention to events such as:

* Resizing PVCs when it is running out of capacity
* Scaling Portworx storage pools to accommodate increasing usage
* Rebalancing volumes across Portworx storage pools when they come unbalanced

The following sections will cover everything from installation to end-to-end examples.
