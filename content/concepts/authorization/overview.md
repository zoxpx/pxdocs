Portworx has always provided support for volume encryption in order to keep data secure. Starting with version 2.1, Portworx introduced support for RBAC. Thus, the platform provides namespace-granular, role-based authentication, authorization, and ownership in addition to encryption.

This document walks you through the different components used to secure _Portworx_ through RBAC.

## General Considerations

Portworx RBAC centers around the ubiquitous JWT based authentication and
authorization model. This technology is currently used by most major internet
systems, providing a proven secure model for user and account identification.

A token is generated by a token authority(TA) and signed using either a private key or a shared secret. Then, the user should provide the token to Portworx for identification. **No passwords are ever sent to Portworx**.

This secure model enables Portworx to only have to verify the validity of the token to authenticate the user. Portworx then destroys the token ensuring **tokens are never saved on a Portworx system**.

The token contains a section called _claims_ which not only identifies the user but also provides authorization information in the form of RBAC. Portworx uses the RBAC information to determine if the user is authorized to make the request.

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| ACL | Access Control List identifying those accounts which can access a resource|
| claims | Information contained in the payload of the JWT identifying the owner of the request |
| CO | Container Orchestration System like Kubernetes, Mesosphere, or Nomad |
| JWT | JSON Web Token |
| OIDC | OpenID Connect |
| RBAC | Role Based Access Control defined by the rules of a role |
| role | A named set of rules |
| rules | A description of the permissions for a role |
| token | A JSON Web Token which is signed by a token authority identifying the owner of the request |
| token authority | Application used to generate and sign an identification token |

## Security Tokens

Portworx security supports two types of token generation models: _OIDC_ and
_self-generated_ tokens. OpenID Connect (or OIDC) is a standard model for user authentication and management and is a great solution for enterprise customers due to its integration with SAML 2.0, Active Directory, and/or LDAP. The second model is a self-generated token, where the administrator would generate a token using their own TA application. For convenience, Portworx provides a method of generating tokens using `pxctl`.

For Portworx to verify the tokens are valid, they must be signed with either a:

* shared secret, or
* an RSA private key, or
* an ECDSA private key.

Also, Portworx must be configured with the same shared secret or pair of keys.

### Required JWT claims

Portworx requires a set of claims to be provided in order to authorize the user. The following table lists the set of required claims:

| Claim | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| iss   | string | Name of the issuer. Portworx utilizes this information to determine if the token was issued by a trusted token authority |
| sub | string | Unique identifier of the user. It is used to determine access control of resources |
| exp | date | Expiration date |
| iat | date | Issued at time |
| name | string | Name of the user |
| email | string | Email of the user. Portworx may be configured to use the email as the unique identifier of the user |
| roles | string array | (custom claim) Portworx RBAC roles |
| groups | string array | (custom claim) List of groups the user is part of, used determine access control of resources |

### Self-Generated Tokens

Token generation can be done by any JWT compliant application which sets the claims required by Portworx. For convenience, administrators can generate user tokens using `pxctl`. See [Generating Tokens](/reference/cli/authorization/#generate-tokens).

### OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Due to its ability to manage thousands of users, it is highly recommended that enterprise customers deploy an OIDC service. There are multiple public and private OIDC providers. Customers could use public providers such as Okta.com, Auth0.com, etc, or private providers such as Keycloak, CloudFoundry UAA, Dex, or Tremolo Security OpenUnison.

In the case where the claims required by Portworx security do not match with those provided by the customer, most OIDCs have a mapping feature. This feature allows the OIDC system to return a token to Portworx where the claims have the appropriate information. Some OIDCs may namespace custom claims. This is supported by Portworx, but the namespace value must be provided to the system during initialization.

## Portworx RBAC Security Models

Portworx RBAC security is composed of three models:

1. **Authentication**: A model for verifying the token is correct and generated from
   a trusted issuer.
2. **Authorization**: A model for verifying access to a particular request type
   according to the role or roles applied to the user.
3. **Ownership**: A model for determining access to resources.


### 1. Authentication

Authentication is based on Role Based Access Control for all clients in the stack and an ownership model that is much like the familiar unix style permissions. Portworx will determine the validity of a user through a token-based model. The token will be created by the TA and will contain information about the user in the _claims_ section. When Portworx receives a request from the user, it will check the token validity by verifying its signature, using either a shared secret or public key provided during configuration.

### 2. Authorization

Once the token has been determined to be valid, Portworx then checks if the user is authorized to make the request. The _roles_ claim in the token must contain the name of an existing default or customer registered role in the Portworx system. A role is the name given to a set of RBAC rules which enable access to certain SDK calls. Custom roles can be created using `pxctl` or through the [OpenStorage SDK](https://libopenstorage.github.io/w/release-6.3.generated-api.html#serviceopenstorageapiopenstoragerole).

See also [Role management using pxctl](/reference/cli/role).

### 3.Ownership

Ownership is the model used for resource control. The model is composed of the owner and a list of groups and collaborators with access to the resource. Groups and collaborators can also have their access to a resource constrained by their access type. The following table defines the three access types supported:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Read | Has access to view or copy the resource. Cannot affect or mutate the resource. |
| Write | Has _Read_ access plus permission to change the resource. |
| Admin | Has _Write_ access plus the ability to delete the resource. |

For example, `user1` could create a volume and give _Read_ access to `group1`. This means that only `user1` can mount the volume. However, `group1` can clone the volume. When a volume is cloned, it is owned by the user who made the request.

## The Administrator Role

Similar to the `root` user in a Linux system, Portworx has the concept of a system administrator. This role is not constrained by RBAC and participates in every group. The built-in RBAC role for system administrators is called `system.admin` and gives the caller access to every API call. To have access to every resource, a user must be in group `*`, which means they are part of every group. Their token claims would then look like this:

```json
{
  "roles" : [ "system.admin" ],
  "groups": [ "*" ]
}
```
