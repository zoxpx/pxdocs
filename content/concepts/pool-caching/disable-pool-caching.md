## Prerequisites

Before you can disable pool caching, you must have a storage pool with caching configured and enabled.

You can use the following commands to check if caching is enabled:

1. First, run the `pxctl status` command the get the id of your pool:

	```text
	pxctl status
	```

	```output
	Status: PX is operational
	License: Trial (expires in 29 days)
	Node ID: abb4723e-efa3-432d-ad27-f929bc658862

		Local Storage Pool: 1 pool

		0	HIGH		raid0		128 GiB	8.4 GiB	Online	default	default

	Global Storage Pool
		Total Used    	:  25 GiB
		Total Capacity	:  384 GiB
	```

2. Run the `pxctl service pool cache status` command with the id of your storage pool as a parameter:

	```text
	pxctl service pool cache status 0
	```

	```output
	Pool ID:  0
		Enabled:  true
		Members:  [/dev/sdc]
		TotalBlocks: 71660
		UsedBlocks: 15
		DirtyBlocks: 0
		ReadHits: 582
		ReadMisses: 168
		WriteHits: 1157
		WriteMisses: 127
		BlockSize: 1048576
		Mode: writeback
		Policy: smq
		Tunables: migration_threshold=20480
	```

## Disable pool caching


1. Enter pool maintenance mode:

    ```text
    pxctl service pool maintenance --enter
    ```

    ```output
    Pool transition operation will restart PX.
    Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): Y
    Pool transition request submitted.
    ```

2. If your cache is running in the default `writeback` mode, you must flush your cache before disabling it:

    `pxctl service pool cache flush <pool_id>`

    The following example flushes the cache on a pool with an ID of `0`:

    ```text
    pxctl service pool cache flush 0
    ```

    ```output
    Pool 0 has completed flush successfully
    ```

3. Enter the `pxctl service pool cache disable` command, specifying the `<pool_id>` of the pool you want to disable caching for:

    `pxctl service pool cache disable <pool_id>`

    The following example disables caching for a pool with an ID of `0`:

    ```terminal
    pxctl service pool cache disable 0
    ```

    ```output
    Pool 0 detached cache successfully
    ```

4. Exit pool maintenance mode:

    ```text
    pxctl service pool maintenance --exit
    ```
    ```output
    Pool transition operation will restart PX.
    Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): Y
    Pool transition request submitted.
    ```

5. At this point, you can run the `pxctl service pool cache status` command to see if caching is disabled:

	```text
	pxctl service pool cache status 0
	```

	```output
	PX Cache Configuration and Status:
	Pool ID:  0
		Enabled:  false
		Members:  [/dev/sdc]
		TotalBlocks: 0
		UsedBlocks: 0
		DirtyBlocks: 0
		ReadHits: 0
		ReadMisses: 0
		WriteHits: 0
		WriteMisses: 0
		BlockSize: 1048576
		Mode: writeback
		Policy: smq
		Tunables: migration_threshold=20480
	```
