This document explains how to manage your _Portworx_ licenses with
`pxctl license`. The CLI lets you add, activate, and transfer licenses. It also gives details about the installed licenses, and it shows what features are available within a given license.

## Overview

Here's how to get the list of the available subcommands:

```text
pxctl license --help
```

```output
Manage licenses

Usage:
  pxctl license [flags]
  pxctl license [command]

Available Commands:
  activate    Activate license from a license server
  add         Add a license from a file
  list        List available licenses
  transfer    Transfer license to remote PX cluster

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for license

Global Flags:
      --ca string        path to root certificate for ssl usage
      --cert string      path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color            output with color coding
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string   context name that overrides the current auth context
  -j, --json             output in json
      --key string       path to client key for ssl usage
      --raw              raw CLI output for instrumentation
      --ssl              ssl enabled for portworx

Use "pxctl license [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Now, let's have a closer look at these commands.

## List available licenses

You can use `pxctl license list` to list installed licenses as follows:

```text
pxctl license list
```

```output

```

As you can see, the command gives details on the features allowed under the current licenses and it also lists the SKU.

## Activate a license

The easiest way to activate a license is to get an **activation id** from _Portworx_. Next, run the following:

```text
pxctl license activate <activation-id>
```

However, there are cases where the servers are configured without access to the Internet. Such customers should request an offline-activation license file, and install it like this:

```text
pxctl license add <license file>
```
