The Portworx `pxctl` CLI tool allows you to run the following service operations:

- Perform a node audit
- Manage the call home feature
- Generate diagnostics package
- Get the version of the installed software
- Configure kvdb
- Place Portworx in maintenance mode
- Manage the physical storage drives

These commands are helpful when you want do debug issues related to your _Portworx_ cluster.

You can see an overview of the available service operations by running:

```text
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl service --help
```

```output
NAME:
   pxctl service - Service mode utilities

USAGE:
   pxctl service command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
     audit, a        Audit the PX node
     call-home       Enable or disable the call home feature
     diags, d        creates a new tgz package with minimal essential diagnostic information.
     drive           Storage drive maintenance
     email           Email setting commands
     exit, e         Stop the PX daemon
     info, i         Show PX module version information

     maintenance, m  Maintenance mode operations
     node-wipe, nw   Wipes PX configuration data on this node
     pool            Storage pool maintenance

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help
```

## Perform a node audit

You can audit the node with:

```text
pxctl service audit
```

```output
AuditID		Error	Message
kvdb-limits	none	KV limits audit not yet available

kvdb-response	none	KV response audit not yet available
```

## Manage the call home feature

With `pxctl`, you can enable and disable the call home feature:

```text
pxctl service call-home enable
```

```output
Call home feature successfully enabled
```

If you want to disable this feature, just run:

```text
pxctl service call-home disable
```

```output
Call home feature successfully disabled
```

## Generate a complete diagnostics package

When there is an operational failure, you can use the `pxctl service diags <name-of-px-container>` command to generate a complete diagnostics package. This package will be automatically uploaded to Portworx if `--upload` is specified. Additionally, the service package can be mailed to Portworx at support@portworx.com. The package will be available at /var/cores/diags.tgz inside the Portworx container.

```text
pxctl service diags --help
```

```output
NAME:
   pxctl service diags - creates a new tgz package with minimal essential diagnostic information.

USAGE:
   pxctl service diags [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   -l, --live                gets diags from running px
   -u, --upload              upload diags to cloud
   -p, --profile             only dump profile
   -a, --all                 creates a new tgz package with all the available diagnostic information.
   -c, --cluster             generate diags for all the nodes in the cluster.
   -f, --force               force overwrite existing diags.
   -o, --output string       output file name (default "/var/cores/diags.tar.gz")
       --dockerhost string   docker host daemon (default "unix:///var/run/docker.sock")
       --container string    PX container ID
   -n, --node string         generate diags for a specific remote node with the provided NodeIp or NodeID.
```

As an example, here's how to generate the diagnostics package for a container called `px-enterprise`:

```text
pxctl service diags --container px-enterprise
```

```output
PX container name provided:  px-enterprise
INFO[0000] Connected to Docker daemon.  unix:///var/run/docker.sock
Getting diags files...
Generated diags: /tmp/diags.tar.gz
```

Enter maintenance mode with:

```text
pxctl service maintenance --enter
```

```output
This is a disruptive operation, PX will restart in maintenance mode.
Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): y
```

Once you're done adding or replacing drives, or adding memory, you can exit maintenance mode by running:

```text
pxctl service maintenance --exit
```

## Manage the physical storage drives

You can manage the physical storage drives on a node using the `pxctl service drive` command:

```text
pxctl service drive --help

      --ssl              ssl enabled for portworx
```

You can add physical drives to a server using the `pxctl service drive add` command. The following example shows how to add a physical drive:

```text
pxctl service drive add --drive /dev/mapper/volume-3bfa72dd -o start
```

```output
Adding drives may make storage offline for the duration of the operation.
Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): y
Adding device  /dev/mapper/volume-3bfa72dd ...
Drive add  successful. Requires restart.
```
<!-- need to test this full operation to confirm the syntax -->

{{<info>}}
To add physical drives, you must place the server in [maintenance mode](#place-portworx-in-maintenance-mode) first.
{{</info>}}

To rebalance the storage across the drives, use the `pxctl service drive rebalance`. This is useful after prolonged operation of a node.

## Display drive information

You can use the `pxctl service drive show` command to display drive information on the server:

```text
pxctl service drive show
```

```output
PX drive configuration:
Pool ID: 0

## Delete all Portworx related data

With `pxctl service node-wipe`, you can delete all data related to Portworx from the node. It will also wipe the storage device that was provided to Portworx. This command can be run only when Portworx is stopped on the node. Run this command if a node needs to be re-initialized.

{{<info>}}
This is a disruptive command and could lead to data loss. Please use caution.
{{</info>}}

```text
pxctl service node-wipe --help
```

```output
NAME:
   pxctl service node-wipe - Wipes PX configuration data on this node

USAGE:
   pxctl service node-wipe [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --storage_devices value, -s value  comma-separated list of storage devices to be wiped.

```

Here is an example:

```text
pxctl service node-wipe
```

```output
This is a disruptive operation.
It will delete all PX configuration files from this node. Data on the storage disks attached on this node will be irrevocably deleted.
Executing manual log rotation logs...
Failed to set pxd timeout. Wipe command might take more time to finish.
Removed PX footprint from device /dev/sdc.
Wiped node successfully.
```

## Perform pool maintenance tasks

The `pxctl service pool` command allows you to run the following pool maintenance related tasks:

- list the available pools
- update the properties of a pool

You can list the available subcommands with:

```text

   pxctl service pool - Storage pool maintenance

USAGE:
   pxctl service pool command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
   show      Show pools
   update    Update pool properties
```

## Update pool properties

You can use the `pxctl service pool update` command to perform the following operations:

- Resize a pool
- Set the IO priority
- Add labels

To see the list of the available subcommands, run:

```text
pxctl service pool update --help
```

```output
Update pool properties

Usage:
  pxctl service pool update [flags]

Flags:
      --resize               extend pool to maximum available physical storage
      --io_priority string   IO Priority (Valid Values: [high medium low]) (default "low")
      --labels string        comma separated name=value pairs (default "NoLabel")
  -h, --help                 help for update
```

#### Understand the --labels flag behavior

The `--labels` flag allows you to add, remove, and update labels for your storage pools.

##### Add a new label

Enter the `pxctl service pool update` command with the pool ID and the `--labels` flag with a comma separated list of labels you wish to add:

```text
pxctl service pool update 0 --labels  ioprofile=HIGH,media_type=SSD
```

##### Replace a label's value

Enter the `pxctl service pool update` command with the pool ID and the `--labels` flag with a comma separated list of the labels you wish to replace:

```text
pxctl service pool update 0 --labels  media_type=NVME
```

Updating a single label does not affect the other labels' stored values.

##### Delete a label's value

Enter the `pxctl service pool update` command with the pool ID and the `--labels` flag with a comma separated list of the labels you wish to delete containing no value:

```text
pxctl service pool update 0 --labels  ioprofile=,media_type=
```

### pxctl service pool show

Show storage pool information

```text
pxctl service pool show
```

```output

```

### pxctl service pool cache

You can use the `pxct service pool cache command` command to:

* Disable caching on a pool
* Enable caching on a pool
* Force the cache to be flushed
* Check if pool caching is enabled for a pool

Refer to the [Pool caching](/concepts/pool-caching) section for more details.

### pxctl service pool delete

You can use the `pxctl service pool delete` command to delete storage pools which may be misconfigured or otherwise not functioning properly.

```text
pxctl service pool delete --help
```
```output
Delete pool
Usage:
  pxctl service pool delete [flags]
Flags:
  -h, --help   help for delete
Global Flags:
      --ca string        path to root certificate for ssl usage
      --cert string      path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color            output with color coding
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string   context name that overrides the current auth context
  -j, --json             output in json
      --key string       path to client key for ssl usage
      --raw              raw CLI output for instrumentation
      --ssl              ssl enabled for portworx
```

Before you remove a pool, consider the following requirements:

* Your target pool for deletion must be empty and contain no replicas
* If your target pool for deletion is a metadata pool, it must be readable
* You must have more pools on the node than just your target pool for deletion
* You must place your node in maintenance mode to use this command

The following example deletes a storage pool from a node containing 2 storage pools:

```text
pxctl service pool delete 0
```
```output
This will permanently remove storage pool and cannot be undone.
Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): y
Pool 0 DELETED.
```

{{<info>}}
**NOTE:** New pools created after a pool deletion increment from the last pool ID. A new pool created after this example would have a pool ID of 2
{{</info>}}
