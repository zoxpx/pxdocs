## 2.6.1.6

November 20, 2020

### Notes

* Portworx licenses for DR are now enabled to work on IBM Cloud.

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-16429 | An issue with applying labels on new pools caused new drive add operations using the `pxctl service drive add` command to fail. <br/><br/>**User impact:** If users tried to add a new Portworx pool to the node, their `pxctl service drive add` command failed with an error message about labels being too long. This prevented users from creating new pools.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx no longer applies the Kubernetes labels to the backend storage pools. |
| PWX-16941 | Portworx installation failed when users set the `VSPHERE_INSTALL_MODE=local` flag to enable the vSphere cloud drive provisioning feature.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx failed to initialize when used in the mode above.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now properly initializes when vSphere cloud drive provisioning is enabled. |

## 2.6.1.5

November 16, 2020

### Notes

* Added support for OCP 4.6.1

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-16796 | For Portworx Essentials users, Portworx ignored the proxy username and password set as part of `PX_HTTP_PROXY`, causing license renewal to fail.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx Essentials clusters entered 'license expired' mode when `PX_HTTP_PROXY` was set. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx Essentials now honors the `Username` and `Password` fields given as part of `PX_HTTP_PROXY` to successfully make connections with the proxy. |
| PWX-16775 | The Google object store did not have pagination for object enumeration, which caused any list call to list everything in the bucket.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Cloudsnap backups and restores failed to start and the request timed out. Listing cloudsnaps through `pxctl` also timed-out.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Added pagination to object enumeration with the Google object store. |

## 2.6.1.4

October 30, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-16432 | `Multipathd` configuration files were not correctly set up for blacklisting Portworx devices. <br/><br/> **User impact:** Incorrect entries in the `Multipathd` configuration file caused other devices to be handled incorrectly on the host. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** This fix disables the updates to the `Multipathd` configuration file by default, and adds an option to enable the updates through the `runc` install argument `-enable-mpcfg-update`. |

## 2.6.1.3

October 14, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10434 | When upgrading to the 2.6.x releases on certain platforms where the CPU does not support the SSE4.2 instruction set, Portworx encountered a checksum mismatch on the log file. <br/><br/>**User impact:** The node would go into storageless mode after the upgrade. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** This patch fixes the log replay so that it does the CPU capability check and uses the right checksum type to verify the log checksum. |

## 2.6.1.2

October 9, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-16417 | Portworx would not recognize the multipath devices. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx nodes came up as a storageless node. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now properly opens /etc/multipath.conf and recognizes Multipath devices. |

## 2.6.1.1

October 7, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-16013 | On certain kernel versions, such as variants of AKS ubuntu kernel 4.15.0, and under certain conditions, the filesystem IO on the backing storage pool sometimes hung due to a kernel bug. <br/><br/> **User impact:** Impacted Portworx pods displayed a 'healthy' node as 'unhealthy', causing downtime for affected users. <br/><br/> **Impact:** This fix patches the filesystem kernel module in variants of AKS ubuntu kernel 4.15.0 and reinserts the patched kernel module, fixing the issue for users on this kernel. |

## 2.6.1 

October 2, 2020

### New features

* [Introducing Portworx on the AWS Marketplace](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/cloud/aws/aws-marketplace/): deploy Portworx from the AWS Marketplace and pay through the AWS Marketplace Metering Service. 

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-16005 | Added support for fetching tokens per vault namespace. | 
| PWX-14307 | Users can instruct Portworx to delete the local snaps created for cloudsnaps after the backup is complete through the `pxctl --delete-local` option. This causes the subsequent backups to be full. | 
| PWX-15987 | The pool expand alert now includes additional information about the cluster ID in the event metrics. |
| PWX-15427 | Volume resize operation status alerts export metrics to Prometheus with additional context, such as: volumeid, clusterid, pvc name, namespace. |
| PWX-13524 | You can now use a network interface for cloudsnap endpoints. This is a cluster-level setting.  |
| PWX-16063 | Introducing a new `px-cache` configuration parameter to control the cache block size for advanced users: `px-runc arg: -cache_blocksize <size>`. | 
| PWX-15897 | Improved Portworx NFS handling in multiple ways: <ul><li>If an unmount operation of the sharedv4 export path fails with `EBUSY`, Portworx restarts the NFS server and tries again.</li><li>If setting the NFS thread count fails - remount the proc FS and set the thread count.</li><li>The NFS thread count now defaults to 128. Portworx now logs an alert if the system is detected as `busy` and requires more NFS threads.|
| PWX-15036 | Traditionally, Portworx installed via Pay-as-you-go or marketplace mode will go into maintenance mode if it is unable to report usage within 72 hours. You can now configure a longer time period, up to 7 days(168 hours), by passing rtOpts `billing_timeout_hours` to the Portworx DaemonSet. If you set an invalid rtOpts value, Portworx returns to 72 hours.| 
| PWX-11884 | Portworx now supports per volume encryption with scaled volumes. DCOS users who use Portworx scaled volumes can provide a volume spec in the following manner to create a scaled volume which uses "mysecret" secret key for encryption: <br/><code>secret_key=mysecret,secure=true,name=myscaledvolume,scale=3</code>	|
| PWX-14950 | Portworx now supports the ability to read vSphere usernames and passwords from a Kubernetes secret directly instead of mounting them inside the Portworx spec.| 
| PWX-15698 | Added a new command, `pxctl service node-usage <node-id>`, that displays all volumes/snapshots with their storage usage and exclusive usage bytes for a given node. Since it traverses through the filesystem, this is an expensive command, and should be used with caution and infrequently. <br/><br/>This change also removes support for or deprecates capacity usage of single volume: `pxctl volume usage` is no longer supported. |
| PWX-16246 | px-runc now features the `-cache_blocksize <value>` option, which configures cache blocks size for px-cache. this option supports values of 1MB and above and a power of 2. |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-15130 | OCI-Monitor could have left zombie processes when installing Portworx for the first time.<br/><br/>**User impact:** In most cases these zombies were harmless, but they had the potential to lock up the `yum` package system on CentOS hosts in rare circumstances.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** OCI-Monitor now properly cleans up zombie processes.|
| PWX-16240 | The `ETCD_PASSWORD` environment variable was shown in plaintext on `px-runc` and the OCI-Monitor's logs. <br/><br/>**User impact:** The ETCD_PASSWORD environment variable was shown in plaintext in the Portworx/Kubernetes logs. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** The ETCD_PASSWORD is no longer shown in plaintext in the logs.|
| PWX-15806 | KVDB backups are stored under `/var/lib/osd/kvdb_backup` and one of the internal directories of Portworx where storage is mounted. On storageless nodes, KVDB backup files were not getting rotated from the internal directories since there is no storage.<br/><br/>**User Impact**: The backup files could end up filling the root filesystem of the node.<br/><br/>**Resolution**: Only dump the KVDB backup files under `/var/lib/osd/kvdb_backup` which get rotated periodically. |
| PWX-15705 | Application backups can't work with the newer security model of 2.6.0. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Application backups failed after upgrading to Portworx 2.6.0. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** The auth model now works with the older style of auth annotations. |
| PWX-16006 | Under certain circumstances, Portworx doesn't apply all Kubernetes node labels to storage pools.<br/><br/>**User impact:** PVCs using replica affinity on those labels are stuck in the pending state<br/><br/>**Resolution:**  Portworx now performs the Kubernetes node update later in the initialization process. |
| PWX-15961 | If you reconfigured a network device and attempted to restore a cloud backup on a volume from a snapshot, Portworx tried to use the IP of the previous network device in the restore and the cloud backup failed. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Users saw the following error message: "Failed to create backup: Volume attached on unknown () node", and had to manually attach and detach the volume. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now updates the network device when they're reconfigured. |
| PWX-15770 | Portworx sometimes couldn't complete volume export/attach/mount operations for NFS pods before timing-out.<br/><br/>**User impact:** The affected pods failed to deploy. </br><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx no longer retries NFS mount operations in a loop on failure. The timeout for the NFS `unmount` command starts at 2 minutes, and if retried in a loop, an API Mount request can scale up to more than 4 minutes.|
| PWX-15622 | sharedv4 volume mounts timed-out. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** In a slower network or on overloaded nodes, sharedv4 (NFS) volume mounts can timeout and attempt multiple retries. The affected pod never becomes operational and repeatedly shows the `signal: killed` error. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** sharedv4 volume mount operations now wait 2 minutes before timing-out. You can also specify an option to configure the timeout to larger values if required:<br/> `pxctl cluster options update --sharedv4-mount-timeout-sec <value>` |


## 2.6.0.2

September 25, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-16160 | Environment variables were not anonymized. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Sensitive information regarding secrets may potentially have been printed in the logs. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Portworx now anonymizes all environment variables. |

## 2.6.0.1

September 22, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-16005 | Added support for fetching tokens per vault namespace |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-15705 | Application backups can't work with the newer security model of 2.6.0. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Application backups failed after upgrading to Portworx 2.6.0. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** The auth model now works with the older style of auth annotations.

## 2.6.0

August 25, 2020

### Notes

* If you're upgrading an auth-enabled Portworx cluster to Portworx 2.6.0, you must upgrade Stork to version 2.4.5. 
* Operator versions prior to 1.4 and Autopilot currently do not support auth-enabled clusters running Portworx 2.6.0. Support for this is planned for a future release

### New features

* [Announcing guest (public) role access](/concepts/authorization/overview/#guest-access): the guest role allows your users to access and manipulate public volumes.
* Portworx now features K3s support: deploy Portworx on the K3s distribution.
* [Check out proxy volumes (NFS)](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-pvcs/create-proxy-volume-pvcs): use this feature to proxy an external NFS share onto your volumes.
* Introducing automatic cluster-wide capacity distribution and balancing. You can also run [rebalance operations manually](/reference/cli/service/#rebalance-storage-across-drives). 

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-12620 | Added support for the [K3s](https://k3s.io) Kubernetes distribution. <br> Limitation: you must use CSI integration to generate / use PVCs. |
| PWX-12587 | Renamed two Prometheus metrics for the floating license server:  <ul><li>`px_alerts_license_lease_has_expired_total` is now `px_alerts_licenseleaseexpired_total`</li><li>`px_alerts_license_leases_expiring_total` is now `px_alerts_licenseleaseexpiring_total`</li></ul> |
| PWX-12477 | Added a new `pxctl` command for rebalancing storage pools. To see the syntax, use `pxctl service pool rebalance --help`. |
| PWX-14465 | When a KVDB node is offline, if there are both storageless and storage nodes available to failover and no nodes are marked as metadata-nodes, Portworx prefers storage nodes to start the KVDB. |
| PWX-12466 | The `--all` option for the `pxctl cloudmigrate start` command has been deprecated. |
| PWX-10590 | Portworx now reports Prometheus metrics related to its KVDB activity. These metrics start with the following prefix: `px_kvdb_`. |
| PWX-13628 | Improved dynamic updates to the Portworx service in Kubernetes environments. <br/>Changing Kubernetes configuration directives, such as `dnsPolicy`, previously did not propagate to the Portworx service (Portworx service needed to be restarted to apply the changes). After the fix, changing the Kubernetes network configuration now automatically propagates to the Portworx service with no restarts required. |
| PWX-14780 | Changed the threshold of repeated alerts from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. |
| PWX-13806 | Added support for cloudsnaps on the Azure government cloud. To enable this, set the environment variable `AZURE_ENVIRONMENT` to `AzureUsGovernmentCloud`. |
| PWX-13437 | Cloudsnaps now allow for `STANDARD_IA` as the storage class for cloudsnap objects with AWS `-s3`. You can specify the storage class while creating credentials. |
| PWX-12151 | You can now add labels to a sharedv4 volume so that the remote mount/client uses NFSv4. For more information, refer to the [Updating volumes using pxctl](/reference/cli/updating-volumes/) article. |
| PWX-11543 | On node startup, each node will raise an alert if it is unable to connect to any of the endpoints of an external etcd. |
| PWX-15226 | Older Vault clients on older Go versions could leak stale connections to the Vault server if authentication with vault fails. Portworx will now cleanup such stale connections. |
| PWX-12274 | The `pxctl service pool delete` command now prints a list of volumes on the pool. |
| PWX-13398 | Added the dashboards showing the replication status to the spec generator. |
| PWX-15047 | Portworx now raises a detailed error event if installed on nodes without disks. |
| PWX-14666 | Improved the recovery time when a storage node goes down and there is another storageless node running in the same failure domain. </br>The recovery will happen only if the machine (VM) for the downed storage node is also deleted, since the storageless node performing the recovery needs to attach the downed node's drives. |
| PWX-12646 | Entering the`pxctl status` command without a token provides confusing information. <!-- ??? -->|
| PWX-14206 | You can now specify runtime MountOptions for Portworx volumes. </br>Added two new fields to Portworx volumes: <ul><li> `mount_options`: Allows you to specify mount-time options for regular block volume mounts.</li><li>`sharedv4_mount_options`: Allows you to specify (NFS) mount-time options for sharedv4 volumes.</li></ul> |
| PWX-14102 | You can now export a sharedV4 volume outside of a Portworx cluster using specific IP addresses. |
|PWX-10207| You can now override a volume's group field using `pxctl`: <br/><br/> `pxctl volume update --group <GROUP> <VOL_NAME>`|
| PWX-11884 | Portworx now supports per-volume encryption with scaled volumes. DCOS users who use Portworx scaled volumes can provide a volume spec in the following manner:</br> `secret_key=mysecret,secure=true,name=myscaledvolume,scale=3`</br> This example creates a scaled volume that uses the "mysecret" secret key for encryption. |
| PWX-15276 | You can now configure the frequency as well as the memory limit at which the Portworx process's memory heap and stack will be dumped: <ul><li>`-rt_opts heapdump_limit_mb=<mb>`</li><li>`-rt_opts heapdump_frequency_min=<interval-in-minutes>`</li></ul> |
| PWX-11967 | The `pxctl status` command now displays which device is being used for the internal KVDB. This will be shown only on the nodes where the internal KVDB is running. |
| PWX-13718 | Portworx now returns a user-friendly error when a sharedv4 mount command times-out instead of `signal: killed`. |
| PWX-12367 | Cloudsnap metrics fields have changed with this release. Previously, the fields were `px_backup_stats_status`, `px_backup_stats_size`, and `px_backup_stats_duration_seconds`. These are replaced with `px_backup_stats_backup_status`, `px_backup_stats_backup_size`, and `px_backup_stats_backup_duration_seconds`. |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-12672 | Due to an accounting issue, I/O gets delayed when a node goes down under a specific condition<br/><br/>**User impact:** I/O may be delayed for a while, but will recover on its own.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Fix accounting to allow I/O to continue if a node goes down under specific conditions. |
| PWX-14333 | When both the `multipathd` device and the backing device contained the KVDB volume label, Portworx sometimes mistakenly picked up the backing device and failed to mount it. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx failed to come up on the nodes where the internal KVDB was running.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now chooses the `multipathd` device when both `multipathd` and the backing device contain the KVDB volume label. |
| PWX-14937 | Added a fix to allow pool expand using the add-disk operation on storage pools that have a journal partition. <br/><br/>**User impact:** If users installed Portworx with cloud drive provisioning using the auto-journal (`-j auto`), expanding the pool with the `add-disk` operation type failed with a "not supported" error message. Users also saw the same error when using Autopilot to expand the pools. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** If Portworx was installed using the auto-journal, it can now expand pools using the `add-disk` operation type. |
| PWX-11545	| Portworx installations with storage pool caching failed to come up after upgrading from 2.3.x to 2.4 or 2.5. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx failed to become operational after upgrading from 2.3.0 to 2.5.0. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** This change fixes the upgrade path in 2.6.0, allowing you to upgrade from 2.3.0 to 2.6.0 without experiencing a failure. |
| PWX-13777 | Kubernetes makes the information about its services available to pods via environment variables. However, each update to environment variables set for a Portworx pod would result in the restart of the Portworx `systemd` service.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Kubernetes clusters that frequently update services could experience storage interruptions.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** OCI-Monitor now manages the changes to its pod environment variables, so the updates made on the unrelated Kubernetes services will no longer cause restarts of the Portworx `systemd` service. |
| PWX-14160 | The Portworx SDK did not return the list of disks and pools in its response. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Users of the [Portworx SDK](/reference/developer-sdk/) or of the `pxctl -j cluster list` command would see empty `Disks` and `Pools` fields in the response. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** The Portworx SDK handler now populates these 2 missing fields. |
| PWX-13655 | When Portworx went down or restarted, it created detailed logs. On some systems, this operation could take a long time and potentially hang.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Log collection could become unresponsive as a result of this log dump. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Unnecessary logs were removed, eliminating the possibility for log collection to hang. |
|PWX-13086| When a VM running Kubernetes worker node gets deleted, the Portworx drives get deleted.<br/><br/>**User impact:** When a worker node running Kubernetes worker node gets deleted, and the Portworx disks are still attached to the VM, the default vSphere behavior is the disks also get deleted. This causes Portworx to lose its data disk, and hence users will end up losing the Portworx node. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** For vSphere 6.7.3 and above, create Portworx disks (vmdks) such that they don't get deleted on VM deletion by using the `keepAfterDeleteVm` flag. For lower vSphere versions, the issue persists.|
| PWX-11352 | Mounting both `<dir>` and `<dir>/<subdir>` into the Portworx container could lead to excessive accumulation of disk-mounts.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Mounting both `<dir>` and `<dir/subdir>` in Portworx could cause mountpoints to keep accumulating with every service restart, resulting in host slowdown and (eventually) an unresponsive/hung host system. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now checks for overlapping mount directives, and rejects such mount configurations.|
| PWX-12528 | When upgrading Portworx on OpenShift, upgrade operations were blocked. Portworx will no longer make the `/etc/pwx/.private.json` configuration file on the host immutable. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Openshift upgrades could get blocked. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now does not set the immutable flag on the /etc/pwx/.private.json |
| PWX-12952 | etcd compaction sometimes broke the propagation of license updates. <br/><br/>**User impact:** If the etcd database was configured to automatically compact, license updates may not propagate to all the nodes in the cluster.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** etcd compaction no longer breaks the license updates. |
| PWX-12466	| The `--all` option for the `pxctl cloudmigrate start` command is deprecated. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Cloud migration with `-a` option is no longer supported as it would try to migrate internally created snapshots and fail.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Users can invoke cloud migration it at volume/namespace level to avoid getting into this failure. |
| PWX-14648 | Portworx did not honor the storage class parameter `export_options` during volume creation. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Any export options provided to the storage class were not included when the storage class was used. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Portworx now parses `export_options` when they are set as storage class parameters. |
| PWX-14941| On volume creation, Portworx formats the volume and then detaches the block device. This detach can sometimes return an `EBUSY` since the format I/O is yet to be completed. Previously, Portworx used to wait for 10 seconds before retrying the detach and did this up to 10 times. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Volume creation sometimes takes more than 10 seconds. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now immediately tries to detach and then exponentially backs off if it fails. |
| PWX-13528 | Fixed an issue where vSphere 6.5 deletes disks associated with VM on VM Delete.</br><br/>**User impact:** When Portworx is installed using cloud drives on vSphere 6.5, if users delete the VM directly from vSphere without detaching all the disks, the disks will get deleted causing PX to lose quorum. </br><br/>**Resolution:** To ensure the disk is not deleted on VM deletion, you must now provide the `DISK_EXTENSION` environment variable with the disk type as `.pxd` to create a vmdk disk as `.pxd` types. This option currently works with fresh Portworx installations on VMware infrastructure. You cannot upgrade from previous versions to 2.6.0 with `DISK_EXTENSION`.<br/>You do not need to use this on vSphere 6.7u3 and above. |
| PWX-12601 | Restarting the Portworx service while using Objectstore could hang.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Restarting the Portworx service while the uploads local Objectstore was active <!-- I don't understand what exactly was active --> could hang the restart operation for over 5 minutes, and result in the Portworx service being marked as "failed".<br/><br/>**Resolution:** The Portworx service restarts now gracefully and in a timely fashion, stopping active Objectstore uploads. |
|PWX-13542| Portworx running on vSphere using cloud drives fails to come up when it cannot find the path of the attached disk.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx will fail to initialize on the node when it fails to find the device path of the attached disk. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx will now retry for up to 2 minutes to find the path of the attached disk. |
| PWX-15060 | Portworx may generate cores when user tries to restore an incremental backup that was taken under folder within a bucket. Portworx does not support uploading backups to a folder within the bucket. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx may generate cores till the restore is stopped.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** This change fixes the above issue and returns error to the user rather than generating cores. |
| PWX-13178 | In Azure, a disk can be attached anywhere in an availability set. When using availability sets with the auto-disk provisioning feature in Portworx, storageless nodes did not pick up disks left on terminated storage nodes. Ideally, they should have picked up the disks as they can be attached by any VM in the availability set.<br/><br/>**User impact:** When a storage node is terminated in Azure, any online storageless node should pick up the drives left by the storage node and keep the cluster in quorum. Due to incorrect handling of availability sets, storageless nodes did not pick up the drives.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now correctly detects that nodes are part of an availability set and attaches drives left by a storage node in the availability set. |
| PSG-172 | When using CSI in a PKS environment, volume provisioning was not working because an incorrect kubelet host path was used by the CSI sidecar containers.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** CSI PVCs became stuck as "pending" in PKS. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Fixed the Portworx specs to use the correct kubelet host path when using CSI on PKS. |
| PWX-15341 | Portworx installs on AKS started failing on August 21, 2020 due to an Azure backend change which causes VM disk attach APIs to fail when using VMSS. Until Azure fixes this problem, Portworx calls the Azure disk attach API differently as a workaround.<br/><br/>**User impact:** When using auto disk provisioning in an AKS environment with VMSS, Portworx will not be able to attach Azure Managed Disks and, therefore, not come up at all on the cluster.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Changed how Portworx invokes the Azure VM Disk attach API. This will ensure that Azure will not throw an error and let the disk attach go through. |
| PWX-12530 | When a node in ASG terminates, it takes a specific amount of time to release the attached drives, and a new replacement node may fail to start due to a license limitation. This caused Portworx to fail correctly, but it did not retry to restart.  Users had to manually restart Portworx.<br/><br/>**User impact:** When a user is using all node licenses in the cluster and wants to replace a Portworx node with a different one (this can happen during Kubernetes or VM upgrades), the new Portworx node tries to join the cluster, but as the old node is not fully terminated yet, Portworx used to exit with a license limit error. As a result, the user has to manually bounce the new node when the old node is terminated so it can join the cluster.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** On license limit error, Portworx now waits for the old node to fully terminate, and release the cloud disks. Once the old node is fully terminated, the new node will restart, and use the drives from the old node without failing with license limit error. |
| PWX-12611 | When using the auto-disk provisioning feature with auto-scaling groups, if the minimum size of an ASG group is zero, and the user specifies a value for the `maxStorageNodesPerZone` parameter, then Portworx overwrites the user-provided value with zero .<br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx was overriding the user-provided value for the `maxStorageNodesPerZone` parameter with zero, based on the ASG group value. This was causing all new nodes to come up as storage nodes, ignoring the user-provided max storage nodes value.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** When the ASG group minimum value is set to zero, and the user provides a different value, Portworx now does not overwrite the value, honoring the user-provided maxStorageNodesPerZone value.|
| PWX-11338 | With the PX-Cache feature enabled, if any single caching drive goes offline, the entire storage node goes down. <br/><br/>**User impact :** Portworx pools become inaccessible due to single drive failures. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now identifies the pool which should be made offline to sustain the failure of single drive.|
| PWX-12670 | If auto journal is used with px-cache, occasionally it is possible for node wipe to fail clearing the md device that was built internal. Manual md stop, followed by device wipefs needed to reinitialize portworx successfully. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** pxctl sv nw fails to wipe px signature needed during recommission a node.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** There is a timing dependency from within the kernel to release access to used drives even with px stopped. This was causing node wipe to fail. Internally px now handles the failure and ensure it cleans up the drive with a retry and throws appropriate failure if still in use.|
| PWX-11750 | If you specify a caching device using the `-cache` flag, and the specified device does not exist, then the `-cache` flag  will be ignored, and `pxctl` will not display any cache devices.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Caching may not be enabled even if the user has provided the `-cache` option at startup.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now starts if the cache device is not found, and displays an error message. Note that Portworx will display the error message only if the device is a local  `/dev/...` device and cannot be found. <br/>The following error messages will be displayed in the log:<br/>Using storage device as cache: <br/>Device does not exist: <br/>Warning: ignoring non-existing storage device. |
| PWX-15115 | Fixed an issue where pod termination can get stuck if the user deletes a volume. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** If users delete the entire application stack at once, including the volumes, Portworx sometimes deletes the volume before the pod terminates. In such a situation, the pod will not terminate properly,  because the Portworx volume unmount operation will fail for not being able to find the volume.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now correctly handles the situation in which the unmount request is sent for a volume that is no longer present. The pod now terminates properly. |
|PWX-9401| A [bug in Kubernetes 1.13.5 and lower](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/76340) caused the Portworx volume driver to occasionally save annotations from one PVC into the parameters for another. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Portworx may have created a PVC with a different group ID than the one set in its annotations. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now uses the group value from the PVC annotation that's fetched at runtime from the Kubernetes API during volume creation to ensure the group ID doesn't change.|
| PWX-13362 | Pods may get stuck in the terminating state due to a race condition where the volume gets attached and detached. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users may see pods stuck in the terminating state.  <br/><br/>**Resolution:**  You can solve this issue by restarting the pods. |
| PWX-12288	 | 	Handle a race condition in node decommission which caused the node to be in an inconsistent state where it would stay partially decommissioned and never completed the decommission operation. <br/><br/> **User impact:** Decommissioned node shows in the nodes list. <br/><br>**Resolution:** Due to a race condition in node decommission workflow, Portworx used to leave the decommissioned node in inconsistent state. This has been addressed to avoid this so that decommissioning of node runs to success.|
| PWX-15094 | A nil panic in Portworx sometimes occurred when Portworx successfully created a Vault client while Vault was in an error state.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx returned an error: "too many open file handles" for subsequent vault operations.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx no longer panics when Vault is experiencing an error. |
| PWX-12088 | Portworx used a version of IBM KeyProtect that caused a kernel panic if multiple threads tried to use it.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Portworx nodes experiencing a kernel panic restarted, and some apps did not come back online after recovery.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now uses IBM KeyProtect library v0.3.5, which solves this problem. |
| PWX-13459 | When using Sharedv4 volumes, if the node where the volume was attached was powered down, daemonset pods on surviving nodes became stuck in the **terminating** state. <br/><br/> **User impact:** Users saw stuck **terminating** pods that Kubernetes was unable to recover. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Pods now terminate properly. |
| PWX-15250 | Sometimes, when running Portworx with the internal KVdb, the Portworx service doesn't restart on the node where the internal KVdb runs, because the KVdb devices are still mounted. <br/><br/> **User impact:** If you force-terminate the Portworx service, it'll not start on the nodes running  the internal KVdb <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Portworx now successfully restarts. |
| PWX-10674 | Node decommission in certain cases would keep the cloud drives around and not delete them. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Cloud drives used to linger around in cloud after owned node is decommissioned.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Node decommission now removes the cloud drives which were left undeleted in certain cases. |
| PWX-8385 | Portworx, Inc. discovered a security issue in the method used to provide the secret location to Portworx from a PVC. <br/><br/>**User Impact**: Users could point to a secret in a namespace they could not access in the annotations of a PVC. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** In 2.6, Portworx no longer supports using annotations in the PVC to create volumes. Instead, it uses the same secure method used by CSI and has the StorageClass reference the secret and the secret namespace. |

## 2.5.8

September 1, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-15622 | sharedv4 volume mounts timed-out. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** In a slower network or on overloaded nodes, sharedv4 (NFS) volume mounts can timeout and attempt multiple retries. The affected pod never becomes operational and repeatedly shows the `signal: killed` error. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** sharedv4 volume mount operations now wait 2 minutes before timing-out. You can also specify an option to configure the timeout to larger values if required:<br/> `pxctl cluster options update --sharedv4-mount-timeout-sec <value>` |

## 2.5.7

August 26, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-15341 | Portworx installs on AKS started failing on August 21, 2020 due to an Azure backend change which causes VM disk attach APIs to fail when using VMSS. Until Azure fixes this problem, Portworx calls the Azure disk attach API differently as a workaround.<br/><br/>**User impact:** When using auto disk provisioning in an AKS environment with VMSS, Portworx will not be able to attach Azure Managed Disks and, therefore, not come up at all on the cluster.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Changed how Portworx invokes the Azure VM Disk attach API. This will ensure that Azure will not throw an error and let the disk attach go through. |

## 2.5.6

August 17, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-14845 | Added a new px install argument (VAULT_NAMESPACE), allowing you to set a global vault namespace for Portworx. Provide this argument as a part of the `px-vault` Kubernetes secret. | 
| PWX-13173 | Added support for providing the `vault-namespace` argument in `pxctl` commands: <ul><li>setting cluster-wide secrets: `/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl set-cluster-key --secret_options=vault-namespace=portworx`</li><li>create volume: `/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume create --secure --secret_key=pwx/custom-key --secret_options=vault-namespace=portworx px-vol` </li><li>host attach: `/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl host attach --secret_key=pwx/custom-key --secret_options=vault-namespace=portworx 57416092699073855`</li></ul> |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-14777 | If credentials were deleted from Kubernetes secrets while there were multiple pending references to them in a Portworx cluster, Portworx generated an alert for every pending reference. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Users received an excessive number of alerts. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Portworx now generates only one alert every hour. Portworx, Inc. advises against deleting credentials if there are schedules managed by Stork. |
| PWX-14034 | Portworx did not read all the vault credentials for Kubernetes authentication methods provided in a Kubernetes secret. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx Vault authentication failed.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** With 2.5.6, Portworx now reads all the Kubernetes authentication related input arguments from the Kubernetes secret and Portworx Vault authentication will succeed. | 
| PWX-14937 | Added a fix to allow pool expand using the add-disk operation on storage pools that have a journal partition. <br/><br/>**User impact:** If users installed Portworx with cloud drive provisioning using the auto-journal (`-j auto`), expanding the pool with the `add-disk` operation type failed with a "not supported" error message. Users also saw the same error when using Autopilot to expand the pools. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** If Portworx was installed using the auto-journal, it can now expand pools using the `add-disk` operation type. |
| PWX-15094 | A nil panic in Portworx sometimes occurred when Portworx successfully created a Vault client while Vault was in an error state.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx returned an error: "too many open file handles" for subsequent vault operations.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx no longer panics when Vault is experiencing an error. |
| PWX-14924 | A driver bug caused Portworx with PX-Security enabled to send unauthorized requests to the volumes API, which were rejected.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Users were unable to create PVCs, which appeared stuck in the `Pending` state.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx with PX-Security can once again create PVCs. |

## 2.5.5

July 29, 2020

### Notes

* Portworx 2.5.5 supports OpenShift 4.5.3

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-14102 | You can now export a sharedV4 volume outside of a Portworx cluster using specific IP addresses. |
| PWX-12151 | You can now add labels to a sharedv4 volume so that the remote mount/client uses NFSv4. For more information, refer to the [Updating volumes using pxctl](/reference/cli/updating-volumes/) article. |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-14333 | When both the `multipathd` device and the backing device contain the KVDB volume label, Portworx sometimes mistakenly picked up the backing device and failed to mount it. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx failed to come up on the nodes where internal KVDB was running.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now chooses the `multipathd` device when both `multipathd` and the backing device contain the KVDB volume label. |
| PWX-14399 | A bug introduced in Portworx version 2.5.0, broke the documented procedure to perform a KVDB recovery from dump files.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users had to manually update the config maps and change the labels on the disk to perform the recovery.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** You can now recover your KVDB from dump files with a single command using the [documented procedure](/concepts/internal-kvdb/#recovery). |
| PWX-14164 | Prior to this version, the `pxctl cloudsnap list -a` command sometimes failed to return all cloudsnaps in an objectstore. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now returns all cloudsnaps in an objectstore. |
| PWX-14160 | The Portworx SDK did not return disks and pools in the response. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Users of the [Portworx SDK](/reference/developer-sdk/) or `pxctl -j cluster list` would see empty `Disks` and `Pools` fields in the response. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** The Portworx SDK handler now populates these 2 missing fields. |
| PWX-14648 | Portworx did not honor the storage class parameter `export_options` during volume creation. <br/><br/>**User impact:** any export options provided to the storage class were not included when the storage class was used. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Parse export_options when they are set as storage class parameters. |
| PWX-13149 | On larger workloads, systems that have lots of overwrites on volumes with a node down sometimes causes Portworx run into an assertion failure while updating the in-core metadata and restart.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx containers restart and continue to work.<br/><br/> **Resolution:** With this fix, Portworx will no longer assert or restart during this scenario.|
| PWX-14389 | On vSphere 6.7 and above, Portworx created thin provisioned vmdks even if the user provided `zeroedthick` as the type. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Users couldn't create thick provisioned vmdks on Portworx. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Portworx now correctly creates thick provisioned vmdks when `zeroedthick` is specified. |
## 2.5.4.1

July 27, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-13175 | Portworx now supports sharedv4 volumes on hosts running Flatcar OS. |

## 2.5.4

July 2, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-14106 | Added support for a new environment variable: `PX_HTTP_PROXY`. This allows you to specify an HTTP proxy during Portworx installation, permitting sharedv4 volumes and package installation to work properly on air-gapped environments that lacked their own system-wide HTTP proxy. |
| PWX-14186 | Optimized the timeouts on misconfigured air-gapped systems, so after the first failure to install NFS services, Portworx will refrain from attempting to install NFS services again for a period of 10 minutes. |
| PWX-13011 | Reduced Portworx install/upgrade times on air-gapped environments that drop the outbound network traffic (i.e. where "curl portworx.com" command would hang). |

## 2.5.3

June 24, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-13437 | Cloudsnaps now allow for `STANDARD_IA` as the storage class for cloudsnap objects with AWS `-s3`. The storage class can be specified while creating credentials. |
| PWX-13806 | Added support for cloud snaps on Azure government cloud. To enable this, set the enironmement variable `AZURE_ENVIRONMENT` to `AzureUsGovernmentCloud`. |
|PWX-10207|You can now override a volume's group field using pxctl: <br/><br/> `pxctl volume update --group <GROUP> <VOL_NAME>`|
| PWX-13375 | Portworx now accepts a new install argument `--node_pool_label` to determine which Kubernetes node labels to apply to CloudDrive sets. Portworx will only attach those DriveSets to a node if the node label passed through `--node_pool_label` matches the label on the CloudDrive set. |
|PWX-13510| Added a new runtime option `rt_opts kvdb_failover_timeout_in_mins` to configure kvdb offline node failover timeout. The default value is set to 3 minutes.|

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-13542| PX running on vSphere using cloud drives fails to come up when it cannot find the path of the attached disk.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx will fail to initialize on the node when it fails to find the device path of the attached disk. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx will now retry upto 2 minutes to find the path of the attached disk.|
|PWX-9401| A [bug in Kubernetes 1.13.5 and lower](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/76340) caused the Portworx volume driver to occasionally save annotations from one PVC into the parameters for another. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Portworx may have created a PVC with a different group ID than the one set in its annotations. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now uses the group value from the PVC annotation that's fetched at runtime from the Kubernetes API during volume creation to ensure the group ID doesn't change.|
| PWX-13459 | When using Sharedv4 volumes, if the node where the volume was attached was powered down, daemonset pods on surviving nodes became stuck in the **terminating** state. <br/><br/> **User impact:** Users saw stuck **terminating** pods that Kubernetes was unable to recover. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Pods now terminate properly. |

## 2.5.2.1

June 19, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-13655 | When Portworx went down or restarted, it created detailed logs. On some systems, this operation could take a long time and potentially hang.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Log collection could become unresponsive as a result of this log dump. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Unnecessary logs were removed, eliminating the possibility for log collection to hang. |
| PWX-13777 | The Portworx pod previously passed unnecessary environment variables to the Portworx service, which sometimes caused it to restart more than it needed to. <br/><br/> **User impact:** When the Kubernetes environment changed, users may have experienced storage interruptions due to these restarts. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** The Portworx pod now passes fewer environment variables to the Portworx service, greatly reducing restarts. |


## 2.3.1.3

June 13, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-13086| When a VM running Kubernetes worker node gets deleted, Portworx drives get deleted.<br/><br/>**User impact:** When a worker node running Kubernetes worker node gets deleted and the Portworx disks are still attached to the VM, the default vSphere behavior is the disks also get deleted. This causes Portworx to loose it's data disk and hence users will end up loosing the Portworx node. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** For vSphere 6.7.3 and above, create PX disks (vmdks) such that they don't get deleted on VM deletion by using the `keepAfterDeleteVm` flag. For lower vSphere versions, the issue still persists.|
|PWX-13542| PX running on vSphere using cloud drives fails to come up when it cannot find the path of the attached disk.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Portworx will fail to initialize on the node when it fails to find the device path of the attached disk. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx will now retry upto 2 minutes to find the path of the attached disk.|

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
|PWX-13510| Added a new runtime option `rt_opts kvdb_failover_timeout_in_mins` to configure kvdb offline node failover timeout. Default value is set to 3 minutes.|



## 2.5.0.3

June 12, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-13655 | When Portworx went down or restarted, it created detailed logs. On some systems, this operation could take a long time and potentially hang.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Log collection could become unresponsive as a result of this log dump. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Unnecessary logs were removed, eliminating the possibility for log collection to hang. |

## 2.5.0.2

June 12, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-9401| A [bug in Kubernetes 1.13.5 and lower](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/76340) caused the Portworx volume driver to occasionally save annotations from one PVC into the parameters for another. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Portworx may have created a PVC with a different group ID than the one set in its annotations. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now uses the group value from the PVC annotation that's fetched at runtime from the Kubernetes API during volume creation to ensure the group ID doesn't change.|

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
|PWX-10207|You can now override a volume's group field using pxctl: <br/><br/> `pxctl volume update --group <GROUP> <VOL_NAME>`|

## 2.5.1.3

June 05, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-13086| For vSphere 6.7.3 and above, create PX disks (vmdks) such that they don't get deleted on VM deletion. |
|PWX-13542| Fixed in issue where PX would fail to come up vSphere using cloud drives when it cannot find the path of the attached disk|
|PWX-13510| Added a new runtime option `rt_opts kvdb_failover_timeout_in_mins` to configure kvdb offline node failover timeout. Default value is set to 3 minutes|

## 2.5.2

May 29, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-12737 | Added support for automatic cloud disk management for non-public Azure clouds like US Government, Germany and China clouds. |
| PWX-13082 | You can now configure the frequency with which Portworx takes its KVDB backups using the `kvdb_dump_frequency_minutes` runtime option. |
| PWX-10216 | Added support for Vault Namespaces. |
| PWX-12603 | When sharedv4 volumes are in use, Portworx uses 16 NFS threads to process them by default. You can change the total number of threads Portworx uses by running the `pxctl cluster options update --sharedv4-threads <num>` command. |
| PWX-12512 | PX-Essential can now refresh licenses through an HTTP or HTTPS proxy. |
| PWX-13116 | Users can now request max backups to be enumerated anywhere between > 0 and < 5000. |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-13189 | A recursive `chmod` operation in Kubernetes 1.18 and lower caused mounts with large block volumes to hang when users set a security context for a pod using `fsGroup`. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users with hung mounts would see mount timeouts when creating a pod referencing large block volumes, and pod creation would fail. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx, Inc. added the `allow_others` storage class label that, when set to true, will apply a permission change to the mount path. This label should only be used for Kubernetes versions lower than 1.18. Users on newer Kubernetes versions can return to using `fsGroup` over the Portworx `allow_others=true` label. |
| PWX-12655 | When Portworx images were uploaded to nodes via docker load command, Docker may not have set the image digest properly.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** When the image digest was not available, OCI-Monitor would not detect manually uploaded Portworx images, and would attempt to pull the Portworx image, potentially failing in air-gapped environments.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now has improved image detection, even in cases where image digests are not available. |
| PWX-13171 | The `px_volume_readthroughput`, `px_volume_writethrougput` and `px_volume_iops` metrics did not update.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users may have seen values for these metrics reported as zero.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx once again updates these metrics. |
| PWX-12088 | Portworx used a version of IBM KeyProtect that caused a kernel panic if multiple threads tried to use it.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Portworx nodes experiencing a kernel panic restarted, and some apps did not come back online after recovery.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now uses IBM KeyProtect library v0.3.5, which solves this problem. |
| PWX-12466 | The `--all` option for the `pxctl cloudmigrate start` CLI command has been deprecated. |

## 2.5.1.2

May 28, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-13175 | Portworx now supports sharedv4 volumes on hosts running Flatcar OS. |

## 2.5.1

April 24, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-11638 | Starting with 2.5.1, credentials can be configured without providing secret key or access key to use instance’s IAM capabilities to access cloud provider’s object store. Current support is limited to AWS’s EC2 instance in 2.5.1. |
| PWX-12314 | For {{< pxEssentials >}}, an improvment to the `pxctl status` command now provides the reason for why a license is expired. |


### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-11602 | When Portworx detected an issue with container volumes, for example, if a drive was removed, OCI-Monitor resulted in Portworx pods being stuck in a `CrashLoopBackupOff` state. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Portworx pods in users' clusters would not recover. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** When Portworx (OCI-Monitor) detects an issue with container mounts, it sends a request to Kuberenetes to reset/reinitialize the Portworx pod, which fixes the issue. |
| PWX-12289 | For the CRI-O container runtime, when OCI-Monitor is set to `ImagePullPolicy:IfNotPresent`, it should pull the {{< pxEnterprise >}} image only when the image is not present on the system. The OCI-Monitor incorrectly identified the image as present while it wasn't. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Portworx failed to pull the required image and OCI-Monitor failed. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** The OCI-Monitor `ImagePullPolicy` handling now properly pulls images. |
| PWX-12292 | When using OCI-Monitor, Portworx failed to drain its pods when required. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** OCI-Monitor failed to start and upgrade operations failed. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** OCI-monitor now properly starts and Portworx upgrades. |
| PWX-12252 | For CRI-O integrations, the OCI-Monitor did not copy the install logs into its own output. As a consequence, the OCI-Monitor did not parse/retrieve the `INFO: Module version check: Success` install log line, and always triggered the cordoning/draining of the nodes. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Upgrades to version 2.5.0 stalled on OpenShift and/or CRI-O container-runtime Kubernetes clusters. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Portworx application cordoning and draining during the upgrade process now works properly, allowing upgrades. |
| PWX-12180 | Portworx didn't send license server alerts for errors packaged into the response body of a valid REST call. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Users did not see license server alerts for these kinds of errors. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Portworx now treats these kinds of errors in the same manner as REST errors, and raises alerts accordingly. |
| PWX-11595 | When a Portworx node's storage is down or full, it reports `Not Ready` to Kubernetes to notify the users. In this case, the Portworx node is still available and serves storage in `read-only` mode if it's full, or proxies the storage from other nodes if local storage is not available. |

## 2.5.0.1

April 21, 2020

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-12322 | Portworx failed to start if NFS was in an errored state. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Users could not start Portworx if NFS was errored. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Users can now start Portworx if NFS is errored, and Portworx will now raise an alert instead. |

## 2.5

April 3, 2020

### New features

 * Introducing [PX-Central on-premises](https://2.5.docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/operate-and-maintain-on-kubernetes/pxcentral-onprem/): Deploy your own PX-Central dashboard with Portworx on your own cluster.
 * Introducing [{{< pxEssentials >}}](https://2.5.docs.portworx.com/concepts/portworx-essentials/): A free Portworx license for prototyping and small production clusters.

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-11777 | Added support to the `pxctl volume list` command, allowing you to list snapshots by node IDs: `pxctl volume list -s --node <node-id>`. |
| PWX-11515 | CLI command flags now use `--node` instead of `--node_id` or `--node-id`.<br/><br/>The following commands were modified:<ul><li>pxctl clouddrive inspect --node</li><li>pxctl clouddrive update-labels --node</li><li>pxctl clouddrive delete --node</li><li>pxctl volume list --node</li></ul> |
| PWX-11464 | Portworx now allows non-root user access to sharedv4 volumes by default. To restrict sharedv4 volume access to the root user, set the `allow_others` label to `false`:<br/><br/>`allow_others=false` |
| PWX-11418 | All cluster and node level alerts will now be raised as Kubernetes events. <br/><br/>NODE alerts: <ul><li>Daemonset model: Events are  raised on the Portworx pod running on that node.</li><li>Operator model: Events are raised on the `StorageNode` object created by the Operator for that node.</li></ul>CLUSTER alerts: <ul><li>Daemonset model: Events are raised on an arbitrary object called `Portworx`</li><li>Operator model: Events are raised on the `StorageCluster` object defined in Kubernetes.</li></ul> |
| PWX-10783 | When Portworx restarts, storageless Portworx nodes will automatically detect any new available storage devices and transition themselves into a storage node. |
| PWX-10756 | When running an internal KVDB without a dedicated drive, `pxctl status` now reports a warning saying that such a configuration is not recommended for a production cluster. |
| PWX-10724 | In cloud, you can now add drives to storageless nodes using the `pxctl` CLI. |
| PWX-10371 | `pxctl status` now reports last known failures if Portworx fails to startup on the node. |
| PWX-9834 | An internal KVDB can now run on storageless nodes. In order to run on storageless nodes, you must provide a `-kvdb_dev` in on-prem clusters, while on cloud PX will provision a drive to be used by kvdb. |
| PWX-11774 | A new `pxctl clouddrive listdrives` command allows you to list all the drives in cloud drivesets. On VSphere, this command also lists the datastore for a VMDK in the labels column.


### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10400 | In some situations, a busy volume remained attached even after a pod is terminated in Kubernetes.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Upgrades or other operations relying on the `kubectl drain` command got stuck on a node with these attached volumes.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now detaches these busy volumes from terminated Kubernetes pods. |
| PWX-11753 | Portworx sent the nodeID with cluster-level license alerts: `LicenseExpiring` and `LicenseExpired`. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Customers saw the nodeID associated with license alerts when the clusterID would have been more helpful. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now reports the ClusterID instead of NodeID with the `LicenseExpiring` and `LicenseExpired` license alerts. |
| PWX-11722 | Portworx raised alerts at the `CLUSTER` level that are more appropriately raised at the `NODE` level. <br/><br/> **User impact:** Users may have seen these alerts at a level they did not expect. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Portworx now raises the following alerts as `NODE` instead of `CLUSTER` level:<ul><li>NodeStartFailure:</li><li>NodeStartSuccess:</li><li> NodeStateChange:</li><li>NodeJournalHighUsage:</li><li>NodeTimestampFailure:</li><li>NodeJournalFailure:</li><li>NodeDecommissionSuccess:</li><li>NodeDecommissionFailure:</li><li>NodeDecommissionPending:</li><li> NodeInitFailure:</li><li>NodeMarkedDown:</li></ul> |
| PWX-11637 | Cloudsnaps did not work with some AWS S3 endpoints when bucket name being uploaded to had uppercase letters in the name. <br/><br/>**Customer impact:** Snapshot restore operations involving buckets with uppercase letters failed. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now supports uppercase letters in bucket names when used with S3 endpoints. |
| PWX-11365 | Portworx only checked the health of the NFS service on the default port: 2049. However, as this port is configurable, these checks failed if the NFS port changed. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Users who configured their NFS to use a port other than the default encountered errors.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now checks the health of the NFS service regardless of the port it's running on, and will raise an alert if determines the NFS server is unhealthy. |
| PWX-11280 | Portworx did not update the cloud drive in-progress state after performing a pool expand operation using `resize-disk`. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Users could have seen a misleading output indicating pool expansion was still in-progress from the `pxctl cloud list` command output, even though the operation completed.<br/><br/>**Resoultion:** Portworx now correctly reports the cloud drive status after a `resize-disk` operation. |
| PWX-10749 | If all nodes in a cluster were storageless, Portworx failed to properly install. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Users attempting to install Portworx on a cluster with only storageless nodes would be left with an out-of-quorum cluster, and would have to wipe the whole installation and redo it with storage nodes.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx will no longer form a cluster if it cannot find any storage nodes, and will keep reporting an error until a storage node is added to the cluster. |
| PWX-10711 | On slower systems, Portworx occasionally received an `access denied` error from the NFS, and failed to mount sharedv4 volumes. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Users experiencing this issue had to manually retry the sharedv4 mount operation.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now retries mounting a sharedv4 volume if it gets an access denied error. |
| PWX-11643 | Intermittent vCenter API failures occasionally caused Portworx to fail to find its already attached cloud drives.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Disk operations reliant on the the vCenter API would fail.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now automatically retries operations involving the vCenter API before reporting an error. |


## 2.4

March 3, 2020

### New Features

* Introducing the Portworx license server: Add and manage licenses for multiple Portworx clusters from an on-premises license server. UI integration coming soon.

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| PWX-10852 | Improved prometheus metrics for Portworx |


### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10939| A difference between how Portworx calculates license expiration dates using time-zones and how Flexera calculates expiration dates without time-zones caused Portworx to occasionally consider new licenses "expired" on their first day.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users with multi-part licenses may have been unable to use their multi-part licenses on the first day they activated them.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Licenses once again work on the first day they're applied and license expiration dates for multi-part licenses display accurately.|


## 2.3.6

February 29, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

| **Improvement Number** | **Improvement Description** |
|----|----|
| 11377 | Adding support for the 4.18.0-147.5.1.el8_1.x86_64 kernel. |

## 2.3.5

February 19, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

|**Improvement Number**|**Improvement Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-11000| Portworx now features a Disaster Recovery plan in the IBM Cloud Marketplace. |
|PWX-11122| Portworx now supports dynamic port range change |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-11101| If nodes were decommissioned with pending snapshots, those snapshots contained references to the decommissioned node.<br/><br/>**User impact:** New nodes sometimes failed to come up.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** When a node is now decommissioned, Portworx removes any pending snapshots which had references on the decommissioned node. |
|PWX-10441| Due to a race condition in the logic which handles volume attachments during a Portworx restart, sharedv4 volumes could be  tagged as attached when they were not. <br/><br/>**User impact:** This caused stale entries in `/etc/exports`, which led NFS to error out.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx no longer experiences a race condition at restart, and no longer creates stale entries in `/etc/exports`. |


## 2.3.4

February 3, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

|**Improvement Number**|**Improvement Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10726 | Portworx can now be installed on OpenShift 4.3 when coupled with [Portworx Operator 1.1.1](https://github.com/libopenstorage/operator/releases). |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10974 | In version 2.3.3, Portworx erroneously showed multi-part licenses as "expired" when the license with the earliest expiration date expired. Despite this incorrect reporting, multi-part licenses did not expire and the cluster continued functioning normally. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users may have seen multi-part licenses erroneously marked "expired". <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now correctly displays multi-part license expiration dates. |
| PWX-10967 | PX-Migrate erroneously indicated success when migrating volumes between clusters with the same internal IP addresses. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Migrations under these circumstances failed, but users saw Portworx indicate success. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Px-Migrate now successfully migrates volumes between clusters with the same internal IP addresses. |


## 2.3.3

January 23, 2020

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

|**Improvement Number**|**Improvement Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10819 | `replica anti-affinity` rules have been deprecated. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Volume creation may fail if using replica anti-affinity volume placement strategy or when restoring volume using cloud backup configured with such a policy. <br/><br/>**Recommendation:** Remove anti-affinity rules and use affinity rules with NotIn, NotEqual operators to achieve the same effect. |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10400 | In some situations, a busy volume remained attached even after a pod is terminated in Kubernetes.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Upgrades or other operations relying on the `kubectl drain` command got stuck on a node with these attached volumes.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now detaches these busy volumes from terminated Kubernetes pods. |
| PWX-10809 | Portworx ignored the `max_drive_set_count` field when deployed in disaggregated mode on cloud deployments.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** If an existing node was terminated and replaced without releasing its storage devices, Portworx sometimes brought a new node online as a storage node, exceeding the `max_drive_set_count` field value.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now correctly enforces the `max_drive_set_count` field values. |
| PWX-10627 | Portworx processes license expiration dates based on a combination of {{< pxEnterprise >}} and AddOn licenses. If these licenses expired at different times, Portworx would not accurately report when they would expire. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users with these licenses may have had their cluster's node capacity reduced unexpectedly and may not have been able to start their cluster if it exceeded the remaining available license capacity.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now aligns the license expiration dates and accurately reports when they expire. |

## 2.3.2

December 18, 2019

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

|**Improvement Number**|**Improvement Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10095 | Portworx now restricts access to SharedV4 volumes to nodes requesting a mount on that volume. |
| PWX-10499 | The `storage pool expansion` operation now supports the `auto` option. |
| PWX-10570 | Portworx now accepts the `VAULT_BACKEND` input argument. When `VAULT_BACKEND` is provided, Portworx uses that version of Vault Backend instead of querying Vault's `sys/mounts/*` directory to fetch all the backends. |
| PWX-10535 | If a SharedV4 Portworx volume must be accessed over NFS outside the Portworx cluster, set the label "allow_all_ips=true" on the volume. This will export the volume on 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0, which allows you to mount this volume on any node accessible in the network. |
| PWX-10380 | SharedV4 volumes are now enabled when SELinux is enabled on Portworx nodes. If you expect SELinux labels to be propagated from an NFS client to a server, set the `ExportOptions` on a volume to `security_label`. You can use the following command to update the volume option: `pxctl volume update --export_options security_label <vol-name>` |
| PWX-10690 | Portworx now uses hourly usage billing. At end of billing cycle, customers are charged by the number of hours Portworx ran rather than the maximum number of nodes used in a given billing cycle. |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10366 | Portworx did not delete node region or zone values when instructed. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Portworx continued to show deleted node and region zone labels after users deleted them. This issue persisted over restarts. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now properly deletes these labels and replaces them with the `default` value. |
| PWX-10381 | Portworx enabled a license feature intended only for cloud deployments in on-prem clusters. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** This feature transferred licenses of offline storageless nodes to available nodes when running on an on-prem cluster. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Portworx now only enables this feature when deployed in cloud environments. |
| PWX-10468 | On nodes which were also volume servers and had attached SharedV4 volumes, Portworx did not restart application pods when it entered maintenance mode or was decommissioned. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users experienced I/O errors caused by missing application pods. <br/><br/>**Resolution:**  Portworx nodes now delete the application pods to recover the application. |
| PWX-10575 | On AKS clusters with VM scale sets, if a Portworx node with cloud drives failed to bootstrap, detach operations also failed.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Cloud drives remained attached to non-existent Portworx nodes.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now properly detaches cloud drives if it fails to bootstrap a node. |
| PWX-10525 | Portworx frequently queried etcd to retrieve the storage spec and check storage pool status and pending drive operations. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** These frequent queries placed an unnecessary load on etcd, resulting in higher than expected resource usage. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** This fix limits the periodic calls and makes them only when necessary: on a version update. |
| PWX-10455 | A failure during a volume create operation can result in a partially formatted volume. A subsequent attach on this volume will retry the formatting operation. In the case of xfs volumes, this formatting operation can fail if the new operation finds an xfs signature on the volume from the previous incomplete operation. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Partially formatted xfs volumes could not be attached.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now uses the force flag when retrying the format operation. |
| PWX-10657 | The etcdv3 client Portworx uses currently contains the following critical bug: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10911. When connected to a secure etcd cluster, if the first endpoint goes offline, the etcd client does not failover and fails to create a new connection. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Portworx restarts and does not reconnect to the etcd cluster. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** After restarting, Portworx now reshuffles the list of endpoints so that the etcd client reconnects to the cluster. |
| PWX-10701 | In the `pxctl cluster options update` command, Portworx did not use the configured value associated with the `SnapReservePercent` field for overcommit rules if no label selectors were specified. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Users could not change from the default `SnapReservePercent` value. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** The `SnapReservePercent` value can now be properly configured. |
| PWX-10685 | Portworx accepted invalid inputs to the `pxctl sv drive add --operation status` command. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users adding cloud drives were unable to see the status of their add operations.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now allows only device paths in `pxctl service drive add --operation status` command. |
| PWX-10632 | With the new BlueStore backend, Ceph no longer uses an ext4 formatted backend. As a result, Ceph doesn't mount the drives and Bluestore opens the devices without the `o_excl` flag.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** When installing with the `-a` option, Portworx saw the device as "not in use" and picked it up as its storage device. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** Portworx now uses additional filters based on the device name and on-disk signature to prevent this. |


## 2.3.1.2

December 12, 2019

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10681 | For Portworx deployments using an internal KVDB with kubelet running as a docker container,  a crash or other interruption which downs both Docker and Portworx can leave an outdated socket file on the node. On restart, Docker attempts to reconnect to Portworx, but Portworx waits on kubelet causing a cyclic dependency.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Crashes downing both Portworx and Docker without the chance for cleanup rendered both services unable to recover. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** This fix attempts to address this cyclic dependency. Portworx responds to the outdated socket requests as `not available`, allowing Docker to progress through startup. |



## 2.3.1

November 18, 2019

### New Features

* The `pxctl service pool expand` command is now available, allowing you to expand storage pools by adding drives and consuming unused drive capacity. See the [Expand your storage pool size](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-pvcs/expand-storage-pool/) section of the documentation for more information.

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

|**Improvement Number**|**Improvement Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10148 | If you're using Portworx on Microsoft Azure, Portworx can now expand storage pools by resizing disks. |
| PWX-10332 | Portworx now provides more descriptive error messages for pool expansion failures. |
| PWX-10442 | Added a new flag to the `volume list` command, allowing you to list your volumes per pool UUID: `pxctl volume list --pool-uid <uuid>` |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10414 | Storage pools sometimes fail to come back online after a disk is added as part of a pool expand operation.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Impacted storage pools may remain down, impacting apps. |

## 2.3

November 12, 2019

### New Features

* Introducing new ways to control [volume provisioning](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-pvcs/control-volume-provisioning/): customize provisioning ratios, disable thin provisioning, or disable provisioning entirely.

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

|**Improvement Number**|**Improvement Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-10275| The `pxctl service pool update <pool_ID> --labels` command functionality has improved. Previously, entering the command would overwrite any existing labels. Users wishing to add a label would have to keep track of and repeat the existing labels they wanted to persist. With the improved functionality, Portworx now behaves as follows: <ul><li>If the label does not exist, Portworx adds it to the current set</li><li>If label already exists, Portworx replaces its value</li><li>If you pass a label with a blank value, Portworx removes the label</li></ul>|

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-10155| Portworx storage pool labels do not inherit Kubernetes node labels. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** PVC creation relying on Kubernetes node labels fails.|
|PWX-10239| Entering the `pxctl service drive add -o status` command with a `--spec` flag included causes Portworx to incorrectly add drives. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users entering a status command with the conflicting `--spec` flag can erroneously add new drives. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** With 2.3, Portworx no longer accepts these malformed commands as drive add operations. |
|PSP-1978| Portworx occasionally causes a read/write operation to wait indefinitely on workloads with a large number of overlapping writes. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Impacted volumes enter a read-only state or become unresponsive. |

## 2.2.0.5

December 19, 2019

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10657 | The etcdv3 client Portworx uses currently contains the following critical bug: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10911. When connected to a secure etcd cluster, if the first endpoint goes offline, the etcd client does not failover and fails to create a new connection. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Portworx restarts and does not reconnect to the etcd cluster. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** After restarting, Portworx now reshuffles the list of endpoints so that the etcd client reconnects to the cluster. |
| PWX-10456 | Portworx Inc. currently packages filesystem dependencies required for Linux kernels into an archive in the Portworx container. Under this current scheme, Portworx does not contain new versions of Linux kernels released after it in the archive. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Portworx fails to install on clusters using newer versions of RHEL 8 kernels. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** During installation, Portworx now checks mirrors.portworx.com for the latest filesystem dependencies required for running Linux kernels if it cannot find them locally. |

## 2.2.0.4

December 12, 2019

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10681 | For Portworx deployments using an internal KVDB with kubelet running as a docker container,  a crash or other interruption which downs both Docker and Portworx can leave an outdated socket file on the node. On restart, Docker attempts to reconnect to Portworx, but Portworx waits on kubelet causing a cyclic dependency.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Crashes downing both Portworx and Docker without the chance for cleanup rendered both services unable to recover. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** This fix attempts to address this cyclic dependency. Portworx responds to the outdated socket requests as `not available`, allowing Docker to progress through startup. |

## 2.2.0.3

December 10, 2019

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10661 | Redacted VMware vSphere environment variable values from Portworx logs. |

## 2.2.0.2

November 27, 2019

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10525 | Portworx periodically queries etcd to retrieve the storage spec and check storage pool status and pending drive operations. This fix limits the periodic calls and makes them only when necessary: on a version update. |

## 2.2.0.1

October 25, 2019

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

|**Improvement Number**|**Improvement Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10125 | The Portworx `pxctl service` CLI command now supports [pool deletion](/reference/cli/service#pxctl-service-pool-delete). |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10204 | For Portworx version 2.2.0 on IBM Cloud: If users install Portworx outside of the catalog, Portworx incorrectly starts the metering agent and cannot report usage to the billing server. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** After 72 hours, users' clusters enter maintenance mode |

## 2.2

September 30, 2019

### New Features

* Introducing [Storage pool caching](/concepts/pool-caching/), this feature is available on new clusters only.
* Portworx now features [stateful application backup and cloning](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/stateful-applications/), allowing you new ways to manage your stateful applications.
* Visit [PX-Central](https://central.portworx.com), a place where you can learn all about getting started with Portworx.
* New [jq filtering documentation](/reference/cli/filtering-output-with-jq/) demonstrates how you can filter `pxctl` output.
* The [Portworx CSI](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/csi/) driver is now generally available for Kubernetes 1.13 and higher.

### Improvements

Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

|**Improvement Number**|**Improvement Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-9026 | Previously, to enable sharedv4 volumes while installing Portworx, users were asked to provide the  `ENABLE_SHARED_AND_SHARED_v4` environment variable. <br/><br/>With 2.2, this environment variable is no longer required and sharedv4 volumes are enabled by default. |
| PWX-8165 | The `pxctl cluster provision-status` command with the `--show-labels` flag now displays storage pool labels. |
| PWX-9956 | When encrypting volumes with CSI, users can pass the secret information used for volume encryption through storage class templatized parameters. |
| PWX-9888 | When a Portworx volume is resized, the volume usage metrics are now immediately updated in Prometheus. |
| PWX-9831 | Users can use custom labels to designate nodes as KVdb nodes through the `PX_METADATA_NODE_LABEL` environment variable. |
| PWX-9769 | Users can specify the base path for the Vault secret store using the `VAULT_BASE_PATH` environment variable. |
| PWX-9727 | With 2.2, Portworx raises an alert every time a pool is resized. |
| PWX-9481 | Additional `State` column for the `pxctl clouddrive list` and `pxctl clouddrive inspect` commands makes it easier to see the state of a particular drive. |
| PWX-8951 | The `pxctl` command-line utility now allows users to update the credentials and the cloudsnap schedule for a volume. |
| PWX-9976 | With 2.2, users can update a node's CloudDriveSet labels by running the `pxctl clouddrive update-labels --nodeid <node-id>` command. This is useful for when the `px/metadata-node` label must be set to `true` on a node which is part of an operational cluster. |
| PWX-8534 | The `pxctl cloudsnap list` command provides pagination and the users can now specify filters for listing only certain types of backups. By default, migration-related backups are not displayed. |

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-9991 | Using Talisman to upgrade Portworx from version 2.0.x to 2.1 may create a DaemonSet called `portworx-api` with a wrong IP address. As a result, the DaemonSet is not present on the host network. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** This prevented Stork from finding the Portworx service. In turn, users experienced issues while trying to create cluster pairs.<br/><br/> **Resolution:** With 2.2, the upgrade process creates the DaemonSet with the correct IP address. |
| PWX-9777 | If the size of the timestamp file exceeds 10G, Portworx may unexpectedly restart and become stuck in a restart loop. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Users could not access volumes. |
| PWX-9765 | A recent update to the IBM IAM service requires every client to set the "Content-Length" header in their HTPP requests. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** This caused users to see an `BXNIM0109E:Property missing or empty.` error. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** With 2.2, Portworx sets the "Content-Length" header in every request. |
| PWX-9842 | Openshift on IKS: Pods may get stuck in the `terminating` state during teardown. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** This left stale paths for the volumes, causing the pod teardown to get stuck. |
| PWX-9964 | Under certain circumstances, the volume delete operation may fail. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Users may see a `Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers` error, and the delete operation may get stuck for approximately 5 minutes. |
| PWX-9889 | Under certain circumstances, Portworx exposes empty volume usage metrics to Prometheus. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Users are unable to see the correct volume usage metrics in Prometheus. |
| PWX-9883 | When running Portworx with the internal KVdb, the Portworx service may restart on the online nodes during a KVdb failover. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Users see an `Etcd cluster not reachable` error. |
| PWX-9855 | Rebooting the internal KVdb nodes within a short interval resulted in the configmap entries getting cleaned up. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** The internal KVdb doesn't start, and the cluster goes out of quorum. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Check the node labels before performing a KVdb node failover. If the node labels don't allow the node to act as a KVdb node, then don't remove the offline KVdb node from the existing cluster. |
| PWX-9826 | If all the nodes are rebooted at the same time, an application node may try to start the internal KVdb, even though it doesn't have the `px/metadata-node=true` label. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** A storage cloud-drive may get attached to a KVdb node or vice versa. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Make sure that the KVdb drives are only attached to the designated KVdb nodes, and the application nodes don't attach a `DriveSet` belonging to a KVdb node. |
| PWX-9334 | A bug in the Grafana dashboard caused storageless nodes to display as `down` in Grafana. |
| PWX-10031 | If a migration is performed while only the source cluster is licensed for Disaster recovery, Portworx marks the migration as successful even if the resources are not migrated correctly. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** The migrated volume is empty |
| PWX-10000 | The `pxctl volume usage` command errors out on nodes with more than 100 volumes attached. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Users see the following error message: `Error: Get http://localhost:9001/v1/osd-volumes/usage/<VOL_ID>: net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)`. |
| PWX-6894 | For sharedv4 volumes, Portworx provides multi-RW access to the volumes by maintaining a single server and multiple clients. If this type of server goes down, the clients receive an `Unmount` request for the volume. This results in a server with a dangling client reference. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** The sharedv4 volumes might end up attached even if there is no consumer. |
| PWX-9974 | Fixed an issue in which the OpenStorage SDK sends the redirect flag for every request to detach a volume. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Under certain circumstances, the operation of deleting or detaching a volume could timeout after 5 minutes. |
| PWX-9625 | Installing Portworx using a Helm chart on Kubernetes 1.14.3 fails. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** The user sees several helper pods failing because they try to pull an image which doesn't exist. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Fixed by replacing the `kubectl` repo with `https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/kubectl`. |
| PWX-10061 | When running Portworx on Kubernetes, the upgrade process can reset the custom port settings in the `portworx-service` spec to their default values. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Users see an `HTTP error 404` error in `kubelet` while trying to mount a volume. |


### Known Issues

Portworx is aware of the following issues, check future release notes for fixes on these issues:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|**Workaround**|
|----|----|----|
| PWX-10049 | CSI: Due to an issue Kubernetes 1.13, if the Kubelet or Portworx goes offline unexpectedly on a node where a volume is attached, the Kubelet will leave orphaned pod directories under `/var/lib/kubelet/pods/*`. The kubelet logs will report these errors every 2 seconds unless this directory is manually cleaned up. | Move or delete the orphaned pod's directory to stop these logs from showing up. |
| PWX-10057 | CSI: In Kubernetes 1.14 with the Portworx CSI driver, unmount may fail intermittently if a volume is attached to a node where Portworx is down. | If unmount fails, retry once Portworx is back online. |
| PWX-10056 | PX-Security: With security enabled, the `pxctl cloudmigrate status` command returns a blank result even there is cloud migration going on. | Use the `pxctl cloudmigrate status --task_id <your_cloud_migration_task_ID>` command to view the migration status. |
| PWX-8421 | Setting collaborator access on a snapshot using `pxctl` may return an error. | `pxctl` properly updates collaborator access, despite returning an error. |

## 2.1.7

December 12, 2019

### Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PWX-10681 | For Portworx deployments using an internal KVDB with kubelet running as a docker container,  a crash or other interruption which downs both Docker and Portworx can leave an outdated socket file on the node. On restart, Docker attempts to reconnect to Portworx, but Portworx waits on kubelet causing a cyclic dependency.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Crashes downing both Portworx and Docker without the chance for cleanup rendered both services unable to recover. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** This fix attempts to address this cyclic dependency. Portworx responds to the outdated socket requests as `not available`, allowing Docker to progress through startup. |

## 2.1.5

September 13, 2019

### Fixes
The following issues have been fixed in the 2.1.5 release:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-9911 |When running PX-DR, old cloudsnaps might not have been deleted from the objectstore since deletions were triggered only on full backups. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Over time, the objectstore on the PX-DR destination cluster may run out of space. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** With 2.1.5, the next DR cleans up old cloudsnaps and frees up space in the objectstore. |
|PWX-9892 |Asynchronous DR causes a large number of alerts composed of long strings, which resulted in high memory usage. <br/><br/>**User impact:** ETCD disk usage was unnecessarily high.|
|PWX-9873 |The DC/OS ACS token used to communicate with DC/OS secrets APIs expires every 5 days, and the auth workflow does not refresh this token when it expires. <br/><br/>**User impact:** This caused users to see an `Unauthorized` error, which required them to restart Portworx.|
|PWX-9811 |In PKS, unset regions impact volume provisioning. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Volumes would be improperly provisioned into a single region. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** With 2.1.5, an unset region will be set to "default". |

## 2.1.4

August 26, 2019

### Fixes
The following issues have been fixed in the 2.1.4 release:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-9781 |Cloudsnap backup operations may fail during catalog collection. <br/><br/>**User impact:** User operations relying on Cloudsnap may fail. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** With 2.1.4, catalog collection has been disabled. |

## 2.1.3

August 8, 2019

### Improvements
Portworx has upgraded or enhanced functionality in the following areas:

|**Improvement Number**|**Improvement Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-8793|In order to migrate volumes encrypted with an AWS KMS cluster-wide secret between clusters, both clusters must have the same cluster-wide secret.<br/><br/>With 2.1.3, Portworx introduces new CLI commands. These commands allow you to dump the cluster-wide secret from one cluster in order to upload the same cluster-wide secret to the destination cluster where encrypted volumes will be migrated. For more information, visit the [Dump and upload cluster-wide secrets](/reference/cli/dump-upload-cluster-wide-secret/) article.|

### Fixes
The following issues have been fixed in the 2.1.3 release:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
|PWX-8902 |On older versions of Kubernetes configured to use the CRI-O container runtime on CoreOS/RHEL nodes, volume mount operations failed with the following error message: `selinux is enabled on docker. Disable selinux by removing --selinux-enabled from dockerd arguments`<br/><br/>**User impact:** Kubernetes applications running on this particular configuration attempting to use a shared volume never receive their volume and fail to fully start.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** With 2.1.3, Kubernetes application start as expected.|
|PWX-9610 |Portworx used invalid characters for Prometheus metric labels. <br/><br/>**User impact:** Customers using Prometheus experienced errors when attempting to view metrics.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** With 2.1.3, Portworx replaces invalid '/' characters with '_' characters when serving metrics to Prometheus. |
|PWX-9632 |Portworx occasionally detected a public network interface, causing the internal ETCD to attempt to use a public IP address to communicate over blocked ports.<br/><br/>**User impact:** Nodes were unable to form a quorum.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** With 2.1.3, Portworx no longer detects public network interfaces.|

### Known Issues
Portworx is aware of the following issues, check future release notes for fixes on these issues:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|**Workaround**|
|----|----|----|
|PWX-9607 | The `pxctl volume usage` command may fail, causing the storage layer to become unresponsive and freezing storage I/O on the nodes where the volume is provisioned.| With 2.1.3, this command has been hidden. <br/><br/>If you're still on 2.1.2, avoid entering this command. If storage does become unresponsive as a result of `pxctl volume usage`, reboot the nodes on which your volume has been provisioned.|

## 2.1.2

July 24, 2019

### Key Features

1. [Cloud drive support for Microsoft Azure](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/cloud/azure/aks/)
2. [Enhanced Volume placement strategies for advanced volume provisioning rules](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-pvcs/volume-placement-strategies/)
3. Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 with CRI-O

### Enhancements

**PWX-8635** - Add support for the CRI-O container runtime.

_User Impact:_ Portworx has added support for the CRI-O container runtime, with the some log file limitations:

  * The progress bar while downloading images is not available.
  * Progress information while installing Portworx binaries is not available.

**PWX-8665** - Support for optimized restores as a cluster option.

_User Impact:_  Users can now enable optimized restores as a cluster level setting using the CLI.

**PWX-9061** - Add ability to remove path-style enforcement for AWS S3.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, Portworx now supports the disabling of path-style enforcement for S3 with the `--disable-path-style` parameter.

### Key Fixes

**PWX-9352** - Upgrading from 2.0.3.7 to 2.1.1 fails.

_User Impact:_  If you have internal KVDB clusters, upgrading from 2.0.3.7 to 2.1.1 is not supported. {{<companyName>}} recommends upgrading from 2.0.3.7 to 2.1.2.

**PWX-8730** - Allow storageless nodes to join when licenses have been exhausted if offline storageless nodes remain.

_User Impact:_  Previously, rolling upgrades of customer environments in cloud auto-scaling groups may have exceeded licensing quota if storageless nodes were created before offline nodes were removed from the cluster. With 2.1.2, offline nodes no longer count against licensing count.

_Recommendations:_ Upgrade to 2.1.2 to support rolling upgrades in cloud auto-scaling environments. If you are unable to upgrade to 2.1.2, you can work with Portworx support to get temporary licenses that increase the node count until an upgrade to 2.1.2 can be planned.

**PWX-9042** - Secrets can be overwritten with certain commands.

_User Impact:_ with 2.1.2, It is no longer possible to unintentionally overwrite secrets using a combination of the `pxctl secrets set-cluster-key` and `pxctl generate secret` commands.

**PWX-8953** -   (Consul) KVDB does not pass the CA certificate file to the Consul client.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, CAFile is now properly sent to the Consul client.

**PWX-8966** - (ASG) Limit the maximum number of drives you can attach to a node.

_User Impact:_  Previously, attempting to attach too many drives results resulted in errors. With 2.1.2, Portworx introduces a maximum limit of 12 drives per node, and will respond to attempts to add more than 12 drives with the following error: `cannot provide more than 12 number of drives per node`.

**PWX-7374** - AWS SC1 and ST1 EBS volumes are unsupported.

_User Impact:_ It was previously not possible to add SC1 or ST1 EBS volumes using the `pxctl service drive add` command. With 2.1.2, Portworx now supports SC1 and ST1 EBS drive types.

**PWX-8792** - Add backoffs to AWS CloudDrive API calls.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, Portworx now slows calls to the AWS Cloud Drive API at increasingly long intervals if it encounters resource limit errors.

**PWX-8701** - The internal KVDB should use DNS names for peer urls.

_User Impact:_ The internal KVDB tracks peer URLs as potentially ephemeral IP addresses. If the entire cluster becomes unavailable in an outage, Portworx may be unable to reconnect. With 2.1.2, internal KVDB now keeps track of nodes using a DNS, and can therefore reconnect in the event of a total cluster outage.

**PWX-8904** - Introduce timeout on storage requests to avoid possible hung situations when Portworx starts.

_User Impact:_ Previously, Portworx may have failed to start, displaying no active I/O operations. With 2.1.2, storage requests now timeout to avoid possible hung situations on node start.

**PWX-8606** - PVC creation fails if no enforcement type is specified in `VolumePlacementStrategy`.

_User Impact:_  Previously, if you did not specify an enforcement type in `VolumePlacementStrategy`, PVC creation failed. With 2.1.2, Portworx will default to `enforcement: required` if you do not specify an enforcement type.

**PWX-8959** - The Snapshot API does not return a typed error if a snapshot already exists.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, this error message is improved. If you try to create a new snapshot where one already exists, a clearly typed error is now returned.

**PWX-9126** - The `nodiscard` option is impacted by volume resize.

_User Impact:_ Previously, resizing a volume sometimes reset a volume’s `nodiscard` option configuration. With 2.1.2, this has been fixed.

**PWX-8690** - Wipe and upgrade scripts fail on Kubernetes 1.14.

_User Impact:_ Due to a feature deprecation with Kubernetes 1.14, wipe and upgrade scripts did not work. With 2.1.2, The `px-wipe` command now correctly removes Portworx pods on Kubernetes 1.14.

**PWX-9175** - Portworx fails to detect the device path on certain types of AWS ec2 instances.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, Portworx no longer fails to detect the device path on certain types of AWS ec2 instances and operating system combinations.

**PWX-7851** - Storage nodes could be removed by the Kubernetes autoscaler.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, Portworx pods are annotated to prevent node removal by the Kubernetes autoscaler.

**PWX-7493** - Portworx selects undesired network interfaces during autodetection.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, Portworx will avoid selecting the undesired network interfaces during configuration.

**PWX-9053** - The pxctl service node wipe command fails to wipe MDRAID devices.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, MDRAID devices are now correctly wiped with the node wipe command.

**PWX-9046** - Portworx doesn’t recognize MDRAID partitions as journal devices.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, Portworx now recognizes MDRAID partitions as journal devices.

**PWX-9054** - Portworx sometimes fails to detect MDRAID partitions.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, Portworx now detects MDRAID partitions when installed with the `-A` option.

**PWX-8938** - Add “sync” and “noac” sharedv4 mount options.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2,  “sync” and “noac” sharedv4 mount options are now available.

**PWX-8893** - Add support for `max_storage_nodes_per_zone` on AKS clusters on Microsoft Azure.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, Portworx supports the max_storage_nodes_per_zone parameter, allowing it to limit storage nodes on AKS availability sets.

**PWX-9263** - Volumes can now be created with the XFS filesystem without needing to provide the "force_unsupported_fs_type" option.

_User Impact:_ Previously, provisioning an XFS volume erroneously created an EXT 4 formatted volume. With 2.1.2, provisioning an XFS volume now creates a properly formatted XFS volume.

**PWX-8712** - Verify completion of a backup before marking it as complete.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, Portworx now verifies that a backup operation has completed before recording a backup as completed.

**PWX-8733** - During upgrade, pods using volume subpaths produce errors.

_User Impact:_ With 2.1.2, pods using volume subpaths are correctly detected and bounced.

**PWX-9476** - OCI-Monitor should not restart the Portworx service unless required.

_User Impact:_ Previously, if the OCI-Monitor restarted Portworx any time it detected a change in the configuration file. With 2.1.2, the OCI-Monitor will only restart Portworx if it’s necessary.

### Errata

**PWX-9473** - Portworx fails to attach a cloud drive to an Azure AKS scale set VM.

_User Impact:_ Portworx fails to attach a cloud drive with the following error messages: `Failed to detach disk...`, and `Failed to attach drive...`

_Recommendations:_ Portworx is working with Microsoft to resolve this issue, in the meantime, {{<companyName>}} recommends deleting the impacted VM manually in Azure and allowing it to redeploy.

## 2.0.3.8

### Key Fixes

**PWX-9486** - Changes to Portworx runtime configuration.

_User Impact:_ This fix ensures consistent sync times on the backend.

## 2.0.3.7

June 19, 2019

{{<info>}}
Portworx 2.0.3.7 works with Stork 2.1.2. Here are the [release notes](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork/releases/tag/v2.1.2) for Stork 2.1.2.
{{</info>}}

### Key Features and Enhancements

**Feature: PWX-7549** - Provide the ability to add multiple drives to a Portworx node in a single command.

_Customer Impact_:  None. This is an enhancement as previously Portworx only allowed only one drive to be added at a time.

_Recommendations_: Add only one drive at a time or upgrade to 2.0.3.7 to be able to multiple drives.

### Key Fixes

**Issue: PWX-9203** - Connections get reset in networks with long idle time with bursty traffic

_Customer Impact_: In very rare cases, in specific network setups, the connections between the node were seen to be disrupted after many hours of idle time.

_Recommendations_: 2.0.3.7 implements improved  connection keep-alives to keep node-to-node connections active in case of long idle times

**Issue: PWX-9126** - If a volume has the 'nodiscard' option set after the volume gets resized, the 'nodiscard' is not retained.

_Customer Impact_: For customers who have used this option to increase the performance, the performance may drop after a volume gets resized.

_Recommendations_: None. Recommend upgrading to 2.0.3.7

**Issue: PWX-9118** - Adding an LVM drive partition as journal device failed.

_Customer Impact_: Adding a journal device which is LVM drive partition will fail but the error is not clear in the logs. In general, it is not recommended to use LVM partitions as journal devices because of the performance limitations of such devices.

_Recommendations_: Don't use LVM partitions as a journal device. Upgrade to 2.0.3.7 for better handling.

**Issue: PWX-9055** - Installing Portworx with an LVM volume that has a similar name to another LVM volume will deactivate the other LVM volume (not used by Portworx). For e.g, if Portworx is asked use to /dev/mapper/volone and there is another LVM volume with the name /dev/mapper/volone1, volone1 would get deactivated.

_Customer Impact_: In this case, if the customer was using the raw LVM volume for another application, that volume will be deactivated.

_Recommendations_: {{<companyName>}} recommends inspecting the system beforehand and to use volume names for LVM volumes that do not overlap with the existing volumes. To completely avoid the issue, Portworx recommends upgrading to 2.0.3.7.

**Issue: PWX-8717** - Adding a journal device to a storage-less node right after a storage device was added results in Portworx crashing and restarting.

_Customer Impact_: When a user tries to add a journal device to a storage-less node right after adding a storage device,  Portworx might crash and restart. In general, there is no application error as Portworx restarts within the 10 min device timeout interval, but there may be a very brief slow down of the I/Os.

_Recomendations_: The workaround is to restart Portworx after a storage device was added and then add a journal device. Upgrading to 2.0.3.7 will eliminate the need for a restart.

**Issue: PWX-9054** - Using the `-A` option during install does not recognize mdraid partitions.

_Customer Impact_: If the storage disks provided to Portworx during install are from mdraid partitions, Portworx will not recognize them and will come up in storageless mode.

_Recommendations_: There is no workaround. Upgrading to 2.0.3.7 will enable adding mdraid partitions

**Issue: PWX-8904** - Restarting Portworx node could result in not being able to complete the startup sequence.

_Customer Impact_: This was seen in environments where there was heavy I/O with shared and non-shared volumes. Also, there were lots of replicas on the node to which a lot of traffic was being routed to. This resulted in a scenario where the internal credits were exhausted. 2.0.3.7 increased the credits and resource allocation.

_Recommendations_: Upgrading to 2.0.3.7 resolves this issue.

**Issue: PWX-9017** - De-couple OCI-mon constraints from Portworx systemd service limits

_Customer Impact_: With previous releases, if the user changes the oci-mon system constraints/limits, it will get passed on to Portworx systemd service.

_Recommendations_: This is addressed in 2.0.3.7 where the oci-mon limits are no longer passed on Portworx systemd service

**Issue: PWX-8846**  - Storage-less node ended up with stuck I/Os and needed to be restarted.

_Customer Impact_: A storage-less node stopped processing I/Os and had to be restarted to have the resources released.

_Recommendations_: Storage-less node must be restarted to release the resources so application I/O can begin to run. Resources used by volumes which are detached when the node was down are not released when the node comes back online. This was resolved so these resources are now properly released to the global internal resource pool in Portworx.

**Issue: PWX-9042** - Do not allow overwriting of secrets

_Customer Impact_: Users can potentially overwrite their encrypted volume secrets if they end up using the same name for the new secret.

_Recommendations_: Users must double-check if they already have the same name that they are trying to add new secrets to the same cluster. 2.0.3.7 implemented a check to look for existing names before accepting a new secret. This prevents the secret from being overwritten.

## 2.0.3.6

May 30, 2019

### Key Fixes

* PWX-8740 - Cloudsnaps: Do not create multiple grpc clients to px-storage
* PWX-8299 - Core with 'concurrent map writes' when object store on the remote cluster was unreachable

* PWX-8136 - Disable kvproxy audit as it causes the etcd client to trigger unnecessary API requests
* PWX-8098 - Portworx fails to start after reboot on a system with LVM drives and auto-configured journal device

### Errata

* PWX-8161 - If an LVM partition is added as journal device after node initialization, any subsequent system reboot will need the LVM partition to be made visible before starting Portworx. This can be done by running "partprobe"

## 2.0.3.1

March 19, 2019

* PWX-4207 - Fix nil pointer dereferences when creating snapshots via k8s

### Errata

* PWX-3982 After putting a node into maintenance mode, adding drives, and then running “pxctl service m –exit”, the message “Maintenance operation is in progress, cancel the operation or wait for completion” doesn’t specify which operation hasn’t completed. Workaround: Use pxctl to query the status of all three drive operations \(add, replace, rebalance\). pxctl then reports which drive operations are in progress and allows exiting from maintenance mode if all maintenance operations are completed.
* PWX-4016 When running under Kubernetes, adding a node label for a scheduled cloudsnap fails with the error “Failed to update k8s node”. A node label isn’t needed for cloudsnaps because they are read-only and used only for backup to the cloud.
* PWX-4021 In case of a failure while a read-only snapshot create operation is in progress, Portworx might fail to come back up. This can happen if the failure coincides with snapshot creation’s file system freeze step, which is required to fence incoming IOs during the operation. To recover from this issue, reboot the node.
* PWX-4027 Canceling a service drive replace operation fails with the message “Replace cancel failed - Not in progress”. However, if you try to exit maintenance mode, the status message indicates that a maintenance operation is in progress. Workaround: Wait for the drive to replace operation to finish. The replace operation might be in a state where it can’t be canceled. Cancel operations are performed when possible.
* PWX-4039 When running Ubuntu on Azure, an XFS volume format fails. Do not use XFS volumes when running Ubuntu on Azure.
* PWX-4043 When a Portworx POD gets deleted in Kubernetes, no alerts are generated to indicate the POD deletion via kubectl.
* PWX-4050 For a Portworx cluster that’s about 100 nodes or greater: If the entire cluster goes down with all the nodes offline, as nodes come online a few nodes get restarted because they are marked offline. A short while after, the system converges and the entire cluster becomes operational. No user intervention required.
* Key Management with AWS KMS doesn’t work anymore because of API changes in the AWS side. Will be fixed in an upcoming release. Refer to this link for additional details. https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/1043
* When shared volumes are configured with io\_profile=cms, it results in the px-ns process restarting occasionally.

* PWX-4721 - When cloud-snap is performed on a large number of volumes, it results in a Portworx container restart. A workaround is to run cloudsnaps on up to 10 volumes concurrently.

## 1.2.18.0

February 13, 2018

### Key Features and Enhancements

* Improve file import and untar performance when shared volumes are used by Wordpress and tune for WordPress plugin behavior

### Errata \(Errata remains the same from 1.2.11.0 release\)

* PWX-3982 After putting a node into maintenance mode, adding drives, and then running “pxctl service m –exit”, the message “Maintenance operation is in progress, cancel the operation or wait for completion” doesn’t specify which operation hasn’t completed. Workaround: Use pxctl to query the status of all three drive operations \(add, replace, rebalance\). pxctl then reports which drive operations are in progress and allows exiting from maintenance mode if all maintenance operations are completed.
* PWX-4014 The pxctl cloudsnap schedule command creates multiple backups for the scheduled time. This issue has no functional impact and will be resolved in the upcoming release.

## 1.2.16.2

March 19, 2018

* This is a minor update that fixes volume size not updating whenever the content of the encrypted volume is deleted

## 1.2.16.1

March 2, 2018

This is a minor update which adds a new flag to limit or disable the generation of core files \(`-e PXCORESIZE=<size>`\). A value of 0 will disable cores

## 1.2.16.0

February 5, 2018

This is a minor update with performance enhancements for shared volumes to support a large number of directories and files.

### Key Fixes

* Shared volume access latency improvements when managing filesystems with a large number of directories and files

### Errata \(Errata remains the same from 1.2.11.0 release\)

* PWX-3982 After putting a node into maintenance mode, adding drives, and then running “pxctl service m –exit”, the message “Maintenance operation is in progress, cancel the operation or wait for completion” doesn’t specify which operation hasn’t completed. Workaround: Use pxctl to query the status of all three drive operations \(add, replace, rebalance\). pxctl then reports which drive operations are in progress and allows exiting from maintenance mode if all maintenance operations are completed.

## 1.2.14

January 17, 2018

This is a minor update to support the older Linux kernel versions \(4.4.0.x\) that ships with Ubuntu distributions

## 1.2.12.1

January 8, 2018

This is a minor update to support Openshift with SELinux enabled as well as verify with SPECTRE/Meltdown kernel patches

* Verified with the latest kernel patches for SPECTRE/Meltdown issue for all major Linux distros

## 1.2.12.0

December 22, 2017

This is a minor update to enhance metadata performance on a shared namespace volume.

### Key Fixes

* Readdir performance for directories with a large number of files \(greater 128K file count in a single directory\)
* Portworx running on AWS AutoScalingGroup now handles existing devices attached with names such as `/dev/xvdcw` which have an extra letter at the end.
* Occasionally, containers that use shared volumes could get a “transport end point disconnected” error when Portworx restarts. This has been resolved.
* Fixed an issue where Portworx failed to resolve Kubernetes services by their DNS names if the user sets the Portworx DaemonSet DNS Policy as `ClusterFirstWithHostNet`.
* PWX- 4078 When Portworx runs in 100s of nodes, a few nodes show high memory usage.

## 1.2.11.10

December 19, 2017

This is a minor update to address an issue with installing a reboot service while upgrading a runC container.

### Key Fixes

* When upgrading a runC container, the new version will correctly install a reboot service. A reboot service \(systemd service\) is needed to reduce the wait time before a Portworx device returns with a timeout when the Portworx service is down. Without this reboot service, a node can take 10 minutes to reboot.

## 1.2.11.9

December 18, 2017

### Key Fixes

Pass volume name as part of the metrics endpoint so Prometheus/Grafana can display with volume name

* Add current ha level of the volume and io\_priority of the volumes to the metrics endpoint
* Abort all pending I/Os the pxd device during a reboot so speed up reboots
* Move the px-ns internal port from 7000 to 9013
* Remove the unnecessary warning string “Data is not local to the node”
* Add px\_ prefix to all volume labels

### Errata

* Do not manually unmount a volume by using Linux `umount` command for shared volume mounts. This errata applies to the previous versions of Portworx as well.

## 1.2.11.8

December 11, 2017

### Key Fixes

* Fix resync mechanism for read-only snapshots
* Improve log space utilization by removing old log files based on space usage

### Errata

* Do not manually unmount a volume by using Linux `umount` command for shared volume mounts. This errata applies to the previous versions of Portworx as well.

## 1.2.11.7

December 7, 2017

### Key Fixes

* Suppress un-necessary log prints about cache flush
* PWX-4272 Handle remote host shutdowns gracefully for shared volumes. In the past, this could leave stray TCP connections.

### Errata

* Do not manually unmount a volume by using Linux `umount` command for shared volume mounts. This errata applies to the previous versions of Portworx as well.

## 1.2.11.6

November 28, 2017

### Key Fixes

* Provide the capability to drop system cache on-demand \(for select workloads and large memory system\) and turn it off by default

## 1.2.11.5

November 22, 2017

### Key Features and Enhancements

* PWX-4178 Perform snapshots in kubernetes via [annotations](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-snapshots/on-demand/snaps-annotations)

## 1.2.11.4

November 20, 2017

### Key Features and Enhancements

* {{< pxEnterprise >}} container is now available in [OCI Format](/install-with-other/docker/standalone)
* Enhancements for db workloads to handle slow media

### Key Fixes

* PWX-4224 Ignore `sticky` flag when purging old snapshots after a cloudsnap is completed.
* PWX-4220 `pxctl status` shows the first interface IP address instead of the mgmt. IP

## 1.2.11.3

November 16, 2017

### Key Fixes

* Shared volume performance improvements
* Do not take an inline snap in k8s when no valid candidate pvcs are found

### 1.2.11.2

November 11, 2017

### Key Fixes

* Increase file descriptors to support a large number of shared volumes

## 1.2.11.1

November 7, 2017

### Key Fixes

* Fix file descriptors not being released after reporting containers attached to a shared volume

## 1.2.11

October 31, 2017

### Key Features and Enhancements

* You can now update volume labels. The pxctl volume update command has a new option, –label pairs. Specify a list of comma-separated name=value pairs. For example, if the current labels are x1=v1,x2=v2:

  The option “–labels x1=v4” results in the labels x1=v4,x2=v2.

  The option “–labels x1=” results in the labels x2=v2 \(removes a label\).

* Improvements to alerts:
  * Additional alerts indicate the cluster status in much more finer detail. This document has more details on all the alerts posted by Portworx: [Here](/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/monitoring/alerting)
  * Rate limiting for alerts so that an alert isn’t repeatedly posted within a short timeframe.
* You can now update the io\_profile field by using the `pxctl volume update` command so the parameter can be enabled for existing volumes.

### Key Fixes

* PWX-3146 Portworx module dependencies fail to load for openSUSE Leap 42.2, Kernel 4.4.57-18.3-default.
* PWX-3362 If a node is in maintenance mode because of disk errors, the node isn’t switched to a storage-less node. As a result, other resources on the node \(such as CPU and memory\) aren’t usable.
* PWX-3448 When Portworx statistics are exported, they include the volume ID instead of the volume name.
* PWX-3472 When snapshots are triggered on a large number of volumes at the same time, the snap operation fails.
* PWX-3528 Volume create option parsing isn’t unified across Kubernetes, Docker, and pxctl.
* PWX-3544 Improvements to Portworx diagnostics - REST API to retrieve and upload diagnostics for a node or cluster. Diagnostics run using the REST API includes vmstat output and the output of pxctl cluster list and pxctl --json volume list. The diagnostics also include netstat -s before the node went down.
* PWX-3558 px-storage dumps core while running an HA increase on multiple volumes during stress.
* PWX-3577 When Portworx is running in a container environment, it should allow mounts on only those directories which are bind-mounted. Otherwise, Portworx hangs during a docker stop.
* PWX-3585 If Portworx stops before a container that’s using its volume stops, the container might get stuck in the D state \(I/O in kernel\). As a result, ‘systemctl stop docker’ takes 10 minutes as does system shutdown. The default PXD\_TIMEOUT to error out IOs is 10 minutes, but should be configurable.
* PWX-3591 Storage isn’t rebalanced after a drive add operation and before exiting maintenance mode.
* PWX-3600 Volume HA update operations on snapshots cannot be canceled.
* PWX-3602 Removing a node from a cluster fails with the message “Could not find any volumes that match ID\(s\)”.
* PWX-3606 Portworx metrics now include the following: Disk read and write latency stats, volume read and write latency stats, and per-process stats for CPU and virtual/resident memory.
* PWX-3612 When creating or updating a volume, disallow the ability to set both the “shared” and “scale” options.
* PWX-3614 A volume inspect returns the wrong error message when one node in the cluster is down: Could not find any volumes that match ID\(s\).
* PWX-3620 The volume inspect command doesn’t show the replication set status, such as whether the replication set has down members or is in a clean or resync state.
* PWX-3632 After a Kubernetes pod terminates and the Portworx volume unmount/cleanup fails, the kubelet logs include “Orphaned pod &lt;name&gt; found, but volume paths are still present on disk.”
* PWX-3648 After all nodes in a cluster go offline: If a node doesn’t restart when the other nodes restart, the other restarting nodes don’t mark that node as offline.
* PWX-3665 The Portworx live core collection hangs sometimes.
* PWX-3666 The pxctl service diags command doesn’t store all diagnostics for all nodes in the same location. All diagnostics should appear in /var/cores.
* PWX-3672 The watch function stops after a large time change, such as 7 hours, on the cluster.
* PWX-3678 The pxctl volume update command interprets the -s option as -shared instead of -size and displays the message “invalid shared flag”.
* PWX-3700 Multiple alerts appear after a drive add succeeds.
* PWX-3701 The alert raised when a node enters maintenance mode specifies the node index instead of the node ID.
* PWX-3704 After backing up a volume that’s in maintenance mode to the cloud, restoring the volume to any online node fails.
* PWX-3709 High CPU usage occurs while detaching a volume with MySQL in Docker Swarm mode.
* PWX-3743 In the service alerts output in the CLI, the Description items aren’t aligned.
* PWX-3746 When a Portworx upgrade requires a node reboot, the message “Upgrade done” shouldn’t print.
* PWX-3747 When a node exits from maintenance mode, it doesn’t generate an alert.
* PWX-3764 The px-runc install command on a core node fails to configure the PX OCI service and generates the error “invalid cross-device link”.
* PWX-3777 When running under Kubernetes, pods using a shared volume aren’t available after the volume becomes read-only.
* PWX-3778 After adding a drive to a storage-less node fails: A second attempt succeeds but there is no message that the drive add succeeded.
* PWX-3793 When running in Kubernetes, if an unmount fails for a shared volume with the error “volume not mounted”, the volume is stuck in a terminating state.
* PWX-3817 When running under Kubernetes, a WordPress pod is stuck in terminating for almost ten minutes.
* PWX-3820 When running Portworx as a Docker V2 plugin: After a service create –replicas command, a volume is mounted locally on a MySQL container instead of a Portworx container. The Swarm service fails with the error “404 Failed to locate volume: Cannot locate volume”. To avoid this issue, you can now specify the volume-driver with the service create command.
* PWX-3825 When a node is in storage down state because the pool is out of capacity: A drive add fails with the error “Drive add start failed. drive size &lt;size&gt; too big” during an attempt to add the same size disk.
* PWX-3829 Container status in the Portworx Lighthouse GUI isn’t updated properly from Portworx nodes.
* PWX-3843 Portworx stats include metrics for utilized and available bytes, but not for total bytes \(px\_cluster\_disk\_total\_bytes\). As a result, alerts can’t be generated in Prometheus for storage utilization.
* PWX-3844 When you add a snapshot schedule to a volume, the alert type is “Snapshot Interval update failure” instead of “Snapshot interval update success”.
* PWX-3850 If the allocated io\_priority differs from the requested io\_priority, no associated alert is generated.
* PWX-3851 When two Postgres pods attempted to use the same volume, one of the Postgres pods mounted a local volume instead of a Portworx volume.
* PWX-3859 After adding a volume template to an Auto Scaling Group and Portworx adds tags to the volume: If you stop that cluster and then start a new cluster with the same volume, without removing the tags, a message indicates that the cluster is already initialized. The message should indicate that it failed to attach template volumes because the tag is already used. You can then manually remove the tags from the stopped cluster.
* PWX-3862 A volume is stuck in the detaching state indefinitely due to an issue in etcd.
* PWX-3867 When running under Kubernetes, a pod using namespace volumes generates the messages “Orphaned pod &lt;pod&gt; found, but volume paths are still present on disk”.
* PWX-3868 A Portworx cluster shows an extra node when running with ASG templates enabled if the AWS API returns an error when the Portworx container is booting up.
* PWX-3871 Added support for dot and hyphen in source and destination names in Kubernetes inline spec for snapshots.
* PWX-3873 When running under Kubernetes, a volume detach fails on a regular volume, with the message “Failed to detach volume: Failed with status -16”, and px-storage dumps core.
* PWX-3875 After volume unmount and mount commands are issued in quick succession, sometimes the volume mount fails.
* PWX-3878 When running under Kubernetes, a Postgres pod gets stuck in a terminating state during when the POD gets deleted.
* PWX-3879 During volume creation on Kubernetes, node labels aren’t applied on Kubernetes nodes.
* PWX-3888 An HA increase doesn’t use the node value specified in the command if the node is from a different region.
* PWX-3895 The pxctl volume list command shows a volume but volume inspect cannot find it.
* PWX-3902 If a Portworx container is started with the API\_SERVER pointing to Lighthouse and etcd servers are also provided, the Portworx container doesn’t send statistics to Lighthouse.
* PWX-3906 Orphaned pod volume directories can remain in a Kubernetes cluster after an unmount.
* PWX-3912 During a container umount, namespace volumes might show the error “Device or resource busy”.
* PWX-3916 Portworx rack information isn’t updated when labels are applied to a Kubernetes node.
* PWX-3933 The size of a volume created by using a REST API call isn’t rounded to the 4K boundary.
* PWX-3935 Lighthouse doesn’t show container information when Portworx is run as a Docker V2 plugin.
* PWX-3936 A volume create doesn’t ignore storage-less nodes in a cluster and thus fails, because it doesn’t allocate the storage to available nodes.
* PWX-3946 On a node where a cloudsnap schedule is configured: If the node gets decommissioned, the schedule isn’t configured for the new replica set.
* PWX-3947 Simultaneous mount and unmount likely causes a race in teardown and setup.
* PWX-3968 If Portworx can’t find a volume template in an Auto Scaling Group, it dumps core and keeps restarting.
* PWX-3971 Portworx doesn’t install on an Azure Ubuntu 14 Distro with the 3.13.0-32-generic kernel.
* PWX-3972 When you start a multi-node, multi-zone Auto Scaling Group with a max-count specified, Portworx doesn’t start on all nodes.
* PWX-3974 When running under Kubernetes, a WordPress app writes data to the local filesystem after a shared volume remount failure \(due to RPC timeout errors\) during node start.
* PWX-3997 When running under Kubernetes, deleting Wordpress pods results in orphaned directories.
* PWX-4000 A drive add or replace fails when Portworx is in storage full/pool offline state.
* PWX-4012 When using shared volumes: During a WordPress plugin installation, the WordPress pod prompts for FTP site permissions. Portworx now passes the correct GID and UUID to WordPress.
* PWX-4049 Adding and removing Kubernetes node labels can fail during node updates.
* PWX-4051 Previous versions of Portworx logged too many “Etcd did not return any transaction responses” messages. That error is now rate-limited to log only a few times.
* PWX-4083 When volume is in a down state due to a create failure but is still attached without a shared volume export, the detach fails with the error “Mountpath is not mounted”.
* PWX-4085 When running under Kubernetes, too many instances of this message get generated: “Kubernetes node watch channel closed. Restarting the watch..”
* PWX-4131 Specifying -a or -A for providing disks to Portworx needs to handle mpath & raid drives/partitions as well

  **Errata**

* PWX-3982 After putting a node into maintenance mode, adding drives, and then running “pxctl service m –exit”, the message “Maintenance operation is in progress, cancel the operation or wait for completion” doesn’t specify which operation hasn’t completed. Workaround: Use pxctl to query the status of all three drive operations \(add, replace, rebalance\). pxctl then reports which drive operations are in progress and allows exiting from maintenance mode if all maintenance operations are completed.
* PWX-4014 The pxctl cloudsnap schedule command creates multiple backups for the scheduled time. This issue has no functional impact and will be resolved in the upcoming release.
* PWX-4016 When running under Kubernetes, adding a node label for a scheduled cloudsnap fails with the error “Failed to update k8s node”. A node label isn’t needed for cloudsnaps because they are read-only and used only for backup to the cloud.
* PWX-4017 An incremental cloudsnap backup command fails with the message “Failed to open snap for backup”. Logs indicate that the backup wasn’t found on at least on one of the nodes where the volume was provisioned. Workaround: Trigger another backup manually on the nodes that failed.
* PWX-4021 In case of a failure while a read-only snapshot create operation is in progress, Portworx might fail to come back up. This can happen if the failure coincides with snapshot creation’s file system freeze step, which is required to fence incoming IOs during the operation. To recover from this issue, reboot the node.
* PWX-4027 Canceling a service drive replace operation fails with the message “Replace cancel failed - Not in progress”. However, if you try to exit maintenance mode, the status message indicates that a maintenance operation is in progress. Workaround: Wait for the drive to replace operation to finish. The replace operation might be in a state where it can’t be canceled. Cancel operations are performed when possible.
* PWX-4039 When running Ubuntu on Azure, an XFS volume format fails. Do not use XFS volumes when running Ubuntu on Azure.
* PWX-4043 When a Portworx POD gets deleted in Kubernetes, no alerts are generated to indicate the POD deletion via kubectl.
* PWX-4050 For a Portworx cluster that’s about 100 nodes or greater: If the entire cluster goes down with all the nodes offline, as nodes come online a few nodes get restarted because they are marked offline. A short while after, the system converges and the entire cluster becomes operational. No user intervention required.

* Add Linux immutable \(CAP\_LINUX\_IMMUTABLE\) when Portworx is running as Docker V2 Plugin
* Set autocache parameter for shared volumes
* On volume mount, make the path read-only if an unmount comes in if the POD gets deleted or Portworx is restarted during POD creation. On unmount,  delete the mount path.
* Remove the volume quorum check during volume mounts so the mount can be retried until the quorum is achieved
* Allow snapshot volume source to be provided as another Portworx volume ID and Snapshot ID
* Allow inline snapshot creation in Portworx Kubernetes volume driver using the Portworx Kubernetes volume spec
* Post log messages indicating when logging URL is changed
* Handle volume delete requests gracefully when Portworx container is starting up
* Handle service account access when Portworx is running as a container instead of a daemonset when running under kubernetes
* Implement a global lock for kubernetes filter such that all cluster-wide Kubernetes filter operations are coordinated through the lock
* Improvements in unmounting/detaching handling in kubernetes to handle different POD clean up behaviors for deployments and statefulsets

### Errata

* If two containers using the same shared volume are run in the same node using docker, when one container exits, the container’s connection to the volume will get disrupted as well. The workaround is to run containers using shared volume in two different Portworx nodes

## 1.2.9

August 23, 2017

{{<info>}}
**Important:**
If you are upgrading from an older version of Portworx (1.2.8 or older) and have Portworx volumes in the attached state, you will need node reboot after upgrade in order for the new version to take effect properly.
