Portworx data services can be managed and monitored through the [OpenStorage SDK](https://libopenstorage.github.io).


### OpenStorage SDK Ports

When you connect your OpenStorage SDK client to Portworx you can use either the default gRPC port 9020 or the default REST Gateway port of 9021. If the port range has been configured to another location during installation, you will find the OpenStorage SDK ports by grepping for SDK in the Portworx container logs.

### OpenStorage versions

The following table shows the OpenStorage SDK version released in each version of Portworx:
