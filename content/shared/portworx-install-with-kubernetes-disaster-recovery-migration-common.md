### Troubleshooting

If there is a failure or you want more information about what resources were migrated you can `describe` the migration object using `kubectl`:

```text
kubectl -n <migrationnamespace> describe migration mysqlmigration
```

```output

## Pre and Post Exec rules

Similar to snapshots, a PreExec and PostExec rule can be specified when creating a Migration object. This will result in the PreExec rule being run before the migration is triggered and the PostExec rule to be run after the Migration has been triggered. If the rules do not exist, the Migration will log an event and will stop.

If the **PreExec rule fails** for any reason, it will log an event against the object and retry. **The Migration will not be marked as failed.**

If the **PostExec rule fails** for any reason, it will log an event and **mark the Migration as failed**. It will also try to cancel the migration that was started from the underlying storage driver.

As an example, to add pre and post rules to our migration, we could edit our `migration.yaml` file like this:

```text
apiVersion: stork.libopenstorage.org/v1alpha1
kind: Migration
metadata:
  name: mysqlmigration
  namespace: mysql
spec:
  clusterPair: remotecluster
  includeResources: true
  startApplications: true
  preExecRule: mysql-pre-rule
  postExecRule: mysql-post-rule
  namespaces:
  - mysql
```
