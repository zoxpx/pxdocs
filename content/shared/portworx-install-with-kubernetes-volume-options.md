| group             	| The group a volume should belong too. Portworx will restrict replication sets of volumes of the same group on different nodes. If the force group option 'fg' is set to true, the volume group rule will be strictly enforced. By default, it's not strictly enforced. 	| group: "volgroup1"       	|
| fg                	| This option enforces volume group policy. If a volume belonging to a group cannot find nodes for it's replication sets which don't have other volumes of same group, the volume creation will fail.                                                                    	| fg: "true"             	|

| snap_schedule     	| Snapshot schedule. Following are the accepted formats:<br><br>periodic=_mins_,_snaps-to-keep_ <br>daily=_hh:mm_,_snaps-to-keep_ <br>weekly=_weekday@hh:mm_,_snaps-to-keep_  <br>monthly=_day@hh:mm_,_snaps-to-keep_<br><br> _snaps-to-keep_ is optional. Periodic, Daily, Weekly and Monthly keep last 5, 7, 5 and 12 snapshots by default respectively.          	| snap_schedule: periodic=60,10<br><br>snap_schedule: daily=12:00,4<br><br>snap_schedule: weekly=sunday@12:00,2<br><br>snap_schedule: monthly=15@12:00     	|

| journal     	| Flag to indicate if you want to use journal device for the volume's data. This will use the journal device that you used when installing Portworx.

| snapshotschedule.<br>stork.<br>libopenstorage.<br>org | Flag to create scheduled snapshots with Stork. For details about how you can create scheduled snapshots with Stork, see the [Scheduled snapshots](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-snapshots/scheduled/) page. | |
